Over the past two years or so I think I have tried to rewrite my personal site
about 3 or 4 times. Each time with the same goal of making a simple blogging
platform that gets out of the way and just lets me focus on the writing.

Since I find myself with two weeks off of work and its the end of the year /
beginning of the next year I figured I would go for another rewrite this time
with the long term goal of doing the following:

- Get the bootstrapping work out of the way and focus on the writing
- Use this as an opportunity to test out personal projects like `native-bundler`
  and `reroute`
- Be easy to setup and get running with simple additions as I go forward (i.e.
  scale out from an initial product)

## Where to start?

A few months ago I was planning on kicking off this rewrite within the same repo
and site that I have currently, I started by updating to emotion v10, swapping
react-router for reach router and changing all my old content from markdown to
mdx.

This was all too much work to do as part of a rewrite and I begin to question
the benefit of doing such a task.

I decided the other day that it would be a lot simpler to just drop all the
current infrastructure I had around my previous blog and just start fresh.

My hope is that without all the technical debt the previous site had, I could
get this one into a decent spot without much work and focus on the writing.

So this new site is built using a node build script around 150 lines in total,
building off of the awesome work around the MDX language spec, `babel`,
`prettier`, and even `eval`!

## What to do next

- [x] Port over some of the front pages from my current site
- [x] Make a build watch script
- [x] Deploy to now (see if I can deploy as a subdomain on matthamlin.me)
