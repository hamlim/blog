It has been several months, almost a full year, since I have even touched my
blog. In fact I only found out in December that my hosting provider decided to
no longer host my website.

A lot of things have happened since I last blogged. I wasn't able to keep up
with doing open source work last year. However I have started 2018 strong with
at least one commit to an open source project every day.

### 1. New website that is still a work in progress

I have a new website, its still super terrible (still working on the design of
it, also links are all broken everywhere sorry).

Its built using Gatsby, which offers a better markdown to blog post story than
Next js, as well as allows me to pull in some interesting data during build
rather than during run time.

I still need to fix all the links as well as figure out how to even host it, but
at least it is a start.

### 2. A ton of new projects on GitHub

I have started quite a few small projects on GitHub, here is a short list:

1. Resp: [Resp](https://github.com/hamlim/resp)
2. DS: [DS](https://github.com/hamlim/ds)
3. app-config [app-config](https://github.com/hamlim/app-config)
4. React-Lightbox [React-Lightbox](https://github.com/hamlim/React-Lightbox)

I am definitely going to be working on far more of these small projects, I am
mostly using them to fill in personal needs on other side projects.

### 3. Dollar

I started Dollar in 2015 as one of my first, and largest, web apps I have worked
on outside of work. I want to spend a ton of time in 2018, rebuilding the
application using React, and a flux style architecture without redux.

I don't want to force myself to blog a ton in 2018, but I also don't want to
turn this website into yet another stale website. So expect a few more learning
blog posts and other random things to be built on to this.
