If you are a frontend engineer working with view libraries than you have most
likely heard about the recent React updates launched with 16.3.0 (and 16.3.1). I
have been using some of these features for a bit, and noticed some interesting
patterns that begin to appear, and some pitfalls that many developers might fall
into when migrating components and whole applications to use the new 16.3
features.

## Context

I could write a full blog post about the new `context` api in React 16.3,
however I want to keep the post relatively short and to the point.

A few of the patterns I have noticed with the new context api are:

**Providing a default context can be useful.**

If you build UI components for use across a larger application, its unreasonable
to require all of the other react components using your components to also wrap
your component in a provider. A powerful feature of the new context api is being
able to define an initial context value for the consumers. This value will be
used when your context consuming component is rendered in a component tree
without a provider parent.

```jsx
import React, { createContext } from 'react';

const { Provider, Consumer } = createContext({
  theme: {
    light: '#f8f9f9',
    dark: '#374047',
  },
});

const UIComponent = props => (
  <Consumer>
    {({ theme }) => (
      <button
        style={{
          color: theme.light,
          background: theme.dark,
        }}
      >
        Button
      </button>
    )}
  </Consumer>
);
```

**A minor performance improvement for context provider wrappers is to use a key
from state as the context provided**

If you want to wrap your context provider in some wrapper that provides an
update method of some sort, you generally will do something like this:

```jsx
export default class ContextProvider extends Component {
  state = {
    light: '#f8f9f9',
    dark: '#374047',
  };
  updateTheme = args => {
    /* Implementation detail */
  };
  render() {
    return (
      <Provider
        // ⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️
        value={{
          ...this.state,
          updateTheme: this.updateTheme,
        }}
      >
        {this.props.children}
      </Provider>
    );
  }
}
```

However! This will potentially cause unnecessary re-renders, as now the value
provided to the consumers will always be a new object!!!

A simple way to get around this is to construct a nested object in state that is
the context you want to provide:

```jsx
export default class ContextProvider extends Component {
  /* Note this needs to be defined before state below */
  updateTheme = args => {
    /* Implementation detail */
  };
  state = {
    light: '#f8f9f9',
    dark: '#374047',
    context: {
      light: '#f8f9f9',
      dark: '#374047',
      updateTheme: this.updateTheme,
    },
  };
  render() {
    return (
      <Provider value={this.state.context}>
        {this.props.children}
      </Provider>
    );
  }
}
```

## `getDerivedStateFromProps`

So far I have noticed three primary pitfalls of the new static
`getDerivedStateFromProps` lifecycle method on React components.

**Always return a value at the end of the getDerivedStateFromProps method.**

React will ensure to warn you if you ever return `undefined` (which will be the
return value if you don't actively return anything) from the method. A good
example of when this might happen is like this:

```jsx
class App extends React.Component {
  static getDerivedStateFromProps(nextProps, prevState) {
    if (nextProps.value !== prevState.value) {
      return {
        value: nextProps.value,
      };
    }
    // ⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️
  }

  /* implementation detail */
}
```

Note that if `nextProps.value` does equal `prevState.value` then the method will
return `undefined`.

One tip I suggest to resolve this potential issue is to start by adding one last
`return null` at the end of the method when you first add
`getDerivedStateFromProps`:

```jsx
class App extends React.Component {
  static getDerivedStateFromProps(nextProps, prevState) {
    if (nextProps.value !== prevState.value) {
      return {
        value: nextProps.value,
      };
    }
    // Start by adding this, then modify the logic above
    return null;
  }

  /* implementation detail */
}
```

**getDerivedStateFromProps will overwrite any initial state if you conditionally
fall back to default values**

This was a difficult one to debug, but one key thing to keep in mind when using
`getDerivedStateFromProps` is that it will run before the first-ever render.
This can lead to some issues with colliding values between the return of this
method and your component's initial state, for example:

```jsx
class App extends Component {
  static getDerivedStateFromProps(nextProps, prevState) {
    if (nextProps.value !== prevState.value) {
      return {
        value: nextProps.value,
      };
    }
    return null;
  }

  state = {
    // ⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️
    value: this.props.value || 0,
  };

  /* implementation detail */
}
```

In the above snippet, if `this.props.value` is null or undefined initially, then
many would think that the value of `this.state.value` on the initial render will
be `0`, unfortunately because of `getDerivedStateFromProps`, `this.state.value`
will be `this.props.value` always and will never be the fallback of `0`.

So far the only way I found to get around this is to either track if it is the
first time calling `getDerivedStateFromProps`, or to check that
`nextProps.value` is neither null or undefined before the `!==` comparison.

3. If you need to compare to `prevProps` you need to store that information in
   state

This is kind of the largest discussion about this new feature, many developers
have voiced their opinions in adding `prevProps` as another argument to the
method to compare new props with the previous props. The only way to get around
this is to store the needed information from prevProps into state:

```jsx
class App extends Component {
  static getDerivedStateFromProps(nextProps, prevState) {
    const { prevProps } = prevState;
    if (nextProps.value !== prevProps.value) {
      return {
        prevProps: nextProps,
        someDerivedValue: nextProps.value,
      };
    }
    return null;
  }

  state = {
    prevProps: this.props,
    someDerivedValue: 0,
  };
}
```

## `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate`

Coming soon, I haven't written too many components that need this just yet. But
I have a feeling I will be using this a decent amount!
