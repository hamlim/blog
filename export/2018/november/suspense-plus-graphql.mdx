One of the greatest features of adopting GraphQL in my opinion has been the
drive to colocate data requirements with the components that render that data,
this collocation has cut down on the hard split of container and presentational
components and has made it easier to develop features and applications in small
units of code (aka components).

One of the fears about this collocation of data fetching with components that i
have heard a few coworkers discuss has been the idea that having a lot of
components do data fetching all by themselves could lead to a lot of loading
spinners on the application during initial load. This fear derives from the idea
that if every component needs to fetch its own data then we would have hundreds
of components kicking of an Ajax request and we would have to wait for all the
requests to resolve before showing the whole application as it is meant to be
shown to the user.

I think there are two pretty simple ways to get over this fear, the first is
easy to accomplish today, and the second is how I see the future of collocated
data queries with components evolving to. Both of these examples are tightly
coupled to React and GraphQL libraries like Apollo, but could probably be
adopted by other view and data fetching libraries soon enough.

## Current Day Resolved Data Fetching

The current day pattern to get over the need for showing a lot of spinners for
each component that needs to fetch data is to export the data requirement from
each component as a GraphQL fragment that a parent can import and resolve in a
large query.

This pattern would look something like this:

```jsx
// Leaf Component
export default ({ data }) => ( ... )

export const queryFragment = gql`
  fragment CommentsPageComment on Comment {
    id
    postedBy {
      login
      html_url
    }
    createdAt
    content
  }
`

// Parent component
import Leaf, { queryFragment as leafFragment } from './leaf.js'

const appQuery = gql`
  query Comment($repoName: String!) {
    entry(repoFullName: $repoName) {
      comments {
        ...CommentsPageComment
      }
    }
  }
  ${leafFragment}
`;

export default function App({repoName}) {
  return (
    <Query query={appQuery} variables={{ repoName }}>
      {() => ( ... )}
    </Query>
  )
}
```

In this case each leaf component with some data dependencies exports the
component as the default and then exports a named export of the query fragment
that any parent can then either resolve in its own query, or forward on back up
to a grandparent via another export.

This is still a manual process of exporting the query as a fragment from each
component, but it makes the data contract of the component more explicit, and
allows the consumer of the component to determine how it wants to handle data
loading for the component.

Some of the flaws of this mechanism include:

- Manual query composition in the parent
- Needing to pass down the props correctly to the leaf node

## Future State Resolved Data Fetching

Now that we have looked at what the current patterns are for handling collocated
data requirements for components, lets take a peak at the potential future for
data loading with components. In this section we are going to talk about some
unstable API's that are part of the React library, and the related unstable
React Cache library so some of this might change in the future.

So lets look at the above example and how it could be simplified using Suspense:

```jsx
// Leaf component
import { createQueryResource } from 'future-graphql-library';

export const query = createQueryResource(() => gql`
  query Comment($repoName: String!) {
    entry(repoFullName: $repoName) {
      comments {
        id
        postedBy {
          login
          html_url
        }
        createdAt
        content
      }
    }
  }`,
  (props) => ({ repoName: props.repoName })
);

export const Fallback = () => ( ... );

export const duration = 500;

export default function Comments(props) {
  const data = query.read(props);
  return (
    ...
  );
}

// Parent component
import Comments, {
  query as commentsQuery,
  Fallback as CommentsFallback,
  duration as CommentsDuration
} from './leaf.js';

export default function App(props) {
  commentsQuery.preload(props);
  return (
    <>
      <Main/>
        <Suspense
          maxDuration={commentsDuration}
          fallback={<CommentsFallback />}
        >
          <Comments {...props} />
        <Suspense>
    </>
  )
}
```

In this example the comments component (leaf component) exports the following:

- A query resources
- A fallback component
- A duration
- and the component itself

These four things allow the parent consumer to preload the data requirement for
the component, as well as use opinionated fallbacks and loading durations for
the component. The parent component can decide to use local values for some
parts of the Suspense API wrapped around the leaf component if it chooses to do
so.

The future state ideal presented here might look like a bit more work than the
current day state, however it allows both the parent and the leaf components to
be more opinionated about their fallback states, as well as the loading
requirements.

No longer does the parent component need to know where to compose the data
fetching fragment exported from the leaf component, and it also doesn't need to
worry about what values the leaf components query relies upon, it can forward
all props down to the resource from the leaf.

This API enables a tighter coupling between a component and the data it
requests, and also allows parent components to decide when and if they will
preload the data requirements for a leaf component or if it doesn't need to
preload those data requirements.

Ultimately the new Suspense and Concurrent React APIs in conjunction with
GraphQL will offer more unique ways to allow developers to fetch data
requirements while also taking the pain out of managing loading states for those
data requirements.
