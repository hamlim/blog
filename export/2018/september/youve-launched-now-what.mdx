My team recently completed a marathon at the pace of a fast sprint. In about 9
months of total time we went from concept of an architectural rewrite of our
documentation site for Wayfair's Design System, to launching the MVP of that
site. It was an intense 9 months, interspersed with building out multiple new
components for our Design Systems, and maintaining our other components as well.

After having run the marathon, and sprinting across the finish line, I feel like
my eyes are hazy, and the next milestone is nowhere to be seen. The thing I have
been pondering since launch is,

### What do we do now?

Its an interesting mindset to have post launch, I feel like I should be
invigorated to keep working on other tasks, but oddly enough it has left me with
fairly low energy.

I feel like the time in which I feel excited and full of energy is when I am
working on large complicated tasks, trying to find that next mountain to climb
will take a while, hopefully I find it soon.

Let me know how you handle the post-launch feeling, what do you do next after
shipping a large feature/project?
