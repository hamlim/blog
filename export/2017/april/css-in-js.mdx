I have been pretty vocal about writing css within javascript in the past. I used
to be completely against the pattern. I believed in the power of css on its own
and all the benefits of being able to use things like pseudo selectors and
attribute selectors as well. So up until about a month ago I was strictly on the
side of keeping css outside of the javascript files. Now I can't get enough of
it.

It started with experimenting with Styled Components, which I thought was a
pretty cool idea. One of the limitations of styled components is that every dom
node starts to become a styled component. You begin to have several styled
`<div>`'s just to handle layout for different components. In small websites/apps
this can be an alright trade off but in larger applications this gets really
hairy really fast.

Then about two weeks ago I decided to start messing around with Next JS. With
Next comes `styled-jsx` which is a really cool way to handle styling components.
You simply throw a style tag within the component and add your css within a
template literal.

From here on out you can write your regular old css, include pseudo selectors
and other cool things.

However one of the benefits of writing css within a template literal is the
ability to inject things from within your javascript. I started with just
storing my variables in separate modules like below:

```js
export default {
  a: '#F3CC31',
  b: '#4CD385',
  c: '#EA6658',
  d: '#A971C0',
  e: '#51A7E0',
  white: '#FEFEFE',
  black: '#0f0f0f',
  gray: '#ecf0f1',
  softWhite: '#F1F4F5',
};
```

I used these like this:

```jsx
<style>
  {`
  :root {

    --a: ${colors.a};
    --a-muted-one: ${color.convert(`color(${colors.a} lightness(+ 5%))`)};
    --a-muted-two: ${color.convert(`color(${colors.a} lightness(+ 20%))`)};
    --b: ${colors.b};
    --b-muted-one: ${color.convert(`color(${colors.b} lightness(+ 5%))`)};
    --b-muted-two: ${color.convert(`color(${colors.b} lightness(+ 20%))`)};
    --c: ${colors.c};
    --c-muted-one: ${color.convert(`color(${colors.c} lightness(+ 5%))`)};
    --c-muted-two: ${color.convert(`color(${colors.c} lightness(+ 20%))`)};
    --d: ${colors.d};
    --d-muted-one: ${color.convert(`color(${colors.d} lightness(+ 5%))`)};
    --d-muted-two: ${color.convert(`color(${colors.d} lightness(+ 20%))`)};
    --e: ${colors.e};
    --e-muted-one: ${color.convert(`color(${colors.e} lightness(+ 5%))`)};
    --e-muted-two: ${color.convert(`color(${colors.e} lightness(+ 20%))`)};
  }
`}
</style>;
```

I started to realize that you can do a lot more with template literals and css.
If you are used to sass or less or similar setups than you probably use a few
mixins or extends. Turns out mixins are just plain old javascript functions:

```js
export const tablet = cssString => (
  `@media screen and (min-width: 25rem) { ${cssString} }`
);
export const desktop = cssString => (
  `@media screen and (min-width: 45rem) { ${cssString} }`
);
```

And now I can use these "mixins" like this:

```jsx
<style jsx>
  {`
  ${
    tablet(`
    .class {
      color: red;
    }
  `)
  }
`}
</style>;
```

There is one final caveat with Styled-jsx, first off is that there are some
minor bugs on how the selectors are actually set up. Every selector generally
gets an extra `[styled-jsx="some string of numbers here"]` applied to it. This
adds the convenience of "locally-scoped" css, however external strings added to
the css don't get this feature. Which might cause css to break in some
circumstances. There is a pr out currently to add in external css as well which
might not fix this issue, but will allow you to split out that css from the view
if you want to.

Ultimately I think this is going to be my go to setup to handle styles for the
near future. I will always be experimenting with alternative methods, so I will
be sure to add another post if in two months I start writing some fancy new
syntax for my styles.
