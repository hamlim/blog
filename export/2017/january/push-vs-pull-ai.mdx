## Push vs Pull AI Assistants

<img alt="A scene from the movie Her, depicting the main character and his AI" src="/her.jpg" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;" />

If you haven't watched the movie <cite>Her</cite> I really recommend it, its
quite an interesting story exploring a lot of different ideas about
relationships, AI's and individuality. One of the best parts of the movie was
simply the AI, voiced by Scarlett Johansson, which acts as an (almost) always on
voice for the main character.

The thing is that the AI in the movie feels like something that is near
impossible to actually make in the real world, or at least about 50 or more
years away from becoming a reality. This is even more noticeable when you start
to use either Google Assistant, Siri, or even Alexa because all of these "AIs"
are miles away from being the kind of personality of the AI from her.
