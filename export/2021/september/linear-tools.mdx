I've been working a lot within [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) as of late, and
recently I've been hitting the limits of what feels like the fundamental design
limitation of a text based tool for thought.

Mainly, linear tools for note taking enforce linear thinking, and linear
thinking leads to blocking thinking.

Imagine if you computer could only ever do a single task at any moment in time,
so instead of playing music in the background and running a web browser and an
instant messaging application all at once, it could only run one of those
actively at once. You'd hate it!

Linear tools like writing notes (specifically via keyboard input) are
effectively doing the same thing to your brain. You're forcing yourself to only
do one thing at a time. This can work well for many folks, helping them to avoid
distractions, however I've found that my brain tends to wander, I'll jump from
one thing to another and keep 5-, 10-, 25- or more things all floating around in
my head at once.

Now, I could go and migrate over to a tool like Figma or some other visual
canvas-like editor, however I don't necessarily think that this issue is a
either-or kind of problem. There will be times that I can really benefit from
the linear model, and other times where I can really benefit from the infinite
2D canvas of a visual editor.

I don't know if I have a universal realization at the end of this rant of a blog
post, however I think of this more like a self realization that a _"single
mode"_ type of tool for thought isn't a tool that can allow me to fully delve
into.
