**Edit: Updated on January 19th, 2021**

A few recent experiments that I've been thinking on have all been around
exploring CSS variables or custom properties, from those explorations I just
published a new package called
[`simple-props`](https://github.com/ds-pack/simple-props).

This package is heavily inspired by <TwitterMention>roginfarrer</TwitterMention>'s [system-props](https://github.com/roginfarrer/system-props) package (both in
function and implementation), but instead of deriving a value from a theme
object it derives CSS variables representing the value provided.

Let's see this in action, first with a pretty minimal setup:

```tsx
import createSimpleProps from 'simple-props'

let simpleProps = createSimpleProps({
  props: {
    color: true,
    bg: {
      scale: 'color',
      property: 'backgroundColor',
    },
  },
})
```

In the above snippet, we've configured `simpleProps` to handle processing of
both a `color` prop and a `bg` prop, for example:

```tsx highlight=6
function Box(props) {
  let styles = simpleProps(props)
  return <div style={styles} {...props} />
}

render(
  <Box color="$primary" bg="$background">
    Hello World!
  </Box>,
)
```

The `color` and `bg` props in the above example may generate styles that look
like:

```tsx highlight=2-3
<div
  style={{
    color: 'var(--color-primary)',
    backgroundColor: 'var(--color-background)',
  }}
/>
```

> Note: The `simple-props` library doesn't manage creating or defining the above
> CSS variables being used, that part is left up to the implementer

Color and background-color are both fairly basic style props that you could
support, but you could support any prop at all through the config.

### Responsive Styles

In addition to basic props, you can also support styles that change at different
breakpoints too! To do this you need to pass in a `breakpoints` array to the
`createSimpleProps` function:

```tsx highlight=10
import createSimpleProps from 'simple-props'

let simpleProps = createSimpleProps({
  props: {
    color: true,
    bg: {
      scale: 'color',
      property: 'backgroundColor',
    },
  },
})
```

This config will now allow the style props to accept an object mapping a
breakpoint to a particular style value:

```tsx
let style = simpleProps({
  color: {
    _: '$primary',
    200: '$secondary',
  },
})
```

The `_` key is a special reserved key that indicates the value at all
breakpoints, from there the rest of the key-value pairs represent a breakpoint
and the value at that breakpoint!

### Pseudo Selectors

One additional feature that I stole from
[system-props](https://github.com/roginfarrer/system-props) (and that library
stole from Chakra) is the concept of "pseudo-props", or applying some styles
based on a pseudo state. This can be configured by providing the `pseudoProps`
config to `createSimpleProps`:

```tsx highlight=10-13
import createSimpleProps from 'simple-props'

let simpleProps = createSimpleProps({
  props: {
    color: true,
    bg: {
      scale: 'color',
      property: 'backgroundColor',
    },
  },
  pseudoProps: {
    _hover: '&:hover',
    _focus: '&:focus',
  },
})
```

You can now use those pseudo props within the `simpleProps` function:

```tsx
let style = simpleProps({
  _focus: {
    color: '$primary',
  },
})
```

### Putting it All Together

For an example of a fully configured usage of the `simple-props` library, feel
free to look at this [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/simple-props-lf7po)
or this code snippet:

```tsx
import createSimpleProps from 'simple-props'

// We call `createSimpleProps` with some config
// All of this is optional besides the `props` config
let simpleProps = createSimpleProps({
  // a mapping of prop name to either a boolean or an object
  props: {
    // means that the styles generated will support processing
    // a color prop that outputs: { color: `var(--color-[value])` }
    color: true,
    bg: {
      // the variable scale to reference
      scale: 'color',
      // the CSS property to apply the styles as
      property: 'backgroundColor',
    },
  },
  // A mapping of pseudo-prop name to pseudo-selector
  pseudoProps: {
    _hover: '&:hover',
    _focus: '&:focus',
  },
})

// what we get back is a function that we can call with some props:
let styles = simpleProps({
  color: '$primary',
  bg: 'tomato',
})

function Component() {
  return <div style={styles}>Hello World!</div>
}
```
