In years past I've generally felt like new year's resolutions were pretty
useless, however I'd still end up either writing a blog post or internally
identifying a few goals for me to try and tackle in the following year.

I was fully planning on **not** forming any particular new years resolutions for
2021, but the more I <Link href="/blog/2020/december/2020">wrote about my
2020</Link> the more I wanted to try and form a few goals for the following
year.

With all that being said, let's dive in a bit to I guess what I'm calling my new
year's resolutions, I won't be adding much context to these goals, but I did at
least want to publish them somewhere to build up some form of public commitment.

1. Write at least one blog post a month
2. Refresh and refine my career view / perception
3. Launch at least 2 fully developed side projects
