I've started to notice that I've spent a very large amount of my free time on my
Xbox as of late, either grinding out gun camos in Call of Duty, or playing in
the futuristic Night City of Cyberpunk. While I enjoy playing video games, a
recently highlighted <TwitterMention>Naval</TwitterMention> tweet brought up
this piece of sage advice:

<Tweet id="1002107992018333696">Reading is faster than listening. Doing is
faster than watching. &mdash; Naval (@naval)
<a href="https://twitter.com/naval/status/1002107992018333696?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May
31, 2018</a></Tweet>

So in the spirit of both that tweet and
[Marc Andressen's advice](https://a16z.com/2020/04/18/its-time-to-build/), I'm
going to take two weeks of no Xbox game time to hack on a product idea from
start to finish.

I'll hopefully check-in via a few blog posts throughout the sprint, and
hopefully by the end of the time I'll have a product that I can feel satisfied
about.

_Aside: I won't be cutting out video games completely, unfortunately Animal
Crossing has become a bit of a habit as of late, but I feel like it won't eat up
too much of my free time since it's a fairly basic video game to play._
