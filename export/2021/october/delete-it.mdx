I've been collecting some blog posts over the past few weeks in an obsidian note
called Articles to Read, I looked at it today and realized its now over a 150
entries long, and I still haven't read a single one of the posts.

Humans, or at least speaking for myself, like to hold on to things, save them
for later - but if you don't have the energy to do something about it now, you
probably won't in a week.

> tl;dr: Delete it
