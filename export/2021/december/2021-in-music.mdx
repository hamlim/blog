This past year I have been keeping a list of music playlists for each month of
the year, I've mostly been throwing in different tracks (both new and old) that
I found myself interested in listening to during that month.

I don't really know what prompted me to make a playlist for each month of the
year, but I've always generally been a big fan of playlists in general, last
year during Covid I created a really long playlist that I called "2020
Quarantine". Even before that I was generally making playlists for the different
seasons of the year, dating at least back to freshman year of high school
(almost 14 years ago!).

These playlists are sort of a snapshot into my current interests and even
general feelings at the time of the year that I made it.
