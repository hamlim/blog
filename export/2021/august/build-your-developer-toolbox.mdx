One of the common differentiators I see between a senior engineer and a junior
engineer is the depth and bredth of their _developer toolbox_. Generally when I
think of a developer toolbox, I think of a collection of patterns that a
developer may apply to solve a problem.

Frequently I find that the tools in my own developer toolbox tend to be honed
and refined by debugging, but often I can encounter new patterns while exploring
a new topic or a new problem space, additionally reviewing my teammates pull
requests has been an incredible opportunity to add things to my own developer
toolbox.

The actual tools within a developer toolbox usually vary from person to person
and could be entirely different from the rest of the tools as well, and while
you may never work on the same exact thing a second time, these patterns can
still be applied to new situations.

What things are you doing to build your developer toolbox?
