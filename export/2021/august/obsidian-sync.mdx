I recently shifted off of a few other note taking applications to
[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) after they announced the new mobile
applications. I had been looking for a solid editing experience available both
on a laptop as well as on my phone and Obsidian has seemed to be like the right
tool for the job so far!

However, I wanted to keep all my notes in sync across my devices, Obsidian does
offer a paid service to synchronize your notes across platforms but I figure I'd
look into rolling my own since that was one of the recommendations in their
documentation.

I figured [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/) would be the ideal platform to
synchronize my notes since I'm already paying for a decent amount of storage
there. I started looking into it and I couldn't find a reliable way for both the
Dropbox android application and the Obsidian android application to reference
the same vault directory, until I found
[Dropsync / Autosync for Dropbox](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ttxapps.dropsync).
This app let's you choose a folder on your device to sync with Dropbox and it
continues to watch for changes and sync them automatically!

### Setup

So, let's dive in to walk through how you can setup a similar syncing!

First things first, you'll want to install the Dropsync app linked above and
connect it with your Dropbox account.

Then you'll want to setup a sync folder pair, what this step does as I
understand it is create a new folder on your device and also uploads it to
Dropbox. When setting this up you'll need to ensure that it also syncs hidden
folders, since the `.obsidian` directory within a vault is synchronized across
your devices.

Next you'll want to create a vault if you haven't already, once created (or if
you have an existing vault that you want to sync), you'll want to move it on the
computer it is on into the synced folder that Dropsync has just setup.

Once you've moved the vault into the synced folder, it should be uploaded to
Dropbox and you can test it out by editing a file in Obsidian on one device and
checking another device to ensure your edits show up!

### Bonus

I also happen to use a Pixel Slate tablet here and there when I'm away from my
laptop but want a slightly better writing experience. I was able to follow this
exact same setup there (since you can install android applications on chrome
os), and now I'm able to sync content across my phone, my tablet, and my
laptops!
