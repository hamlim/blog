<TLDR>

If you're testing a checkbox input element with React Testing Library, you'll
want to fire a click event on the checkbox _not_ a change event!

Read on to find out how I discovered this!

</TLDR>

I was recently refactoring about 70 individual Enzyme-based unit tests across
our design system codebase at work to swap it for
[React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/),
and encountered an odd quirk that I figured I'd document on my blog.

I was converting some tests for one of our Checkbox Table components, a
component that allows users to select individual rows or the entire page of
results shown within a table. The previous tests were quite extensive, the
entire file was well over 1200 lines of code covering many different and
difficult edge cases.

As I went through I converted one of the tests that was asserting on an
`onChange` handler being properly called when one of the checkboxes was
selected, the previous test code looked something like:

```jsx
const handleChange = jest.fn();
const wrapper = mount(<CheckboxTable onChange={handleChange} />);

wrapper
  .find(`[data-enzyme-id="header-checkbox"]`)
  .simulate('change', { target: { checked: true } });

expect(handleChange).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);
```

So I started converting as I had other tests within the codebase:

```jsx
const handleChange = jest.fn();
render(<CheckboxTable onChange={handleChange} />);

fireEvent.change(screen.getByTestId('header-checkbox'), {
  target: { checked: true },
});

expect(handleChange).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);
```

However, the test started failing!

I started scratching my head after debugging this for about 30 minutes without
making much traction on the failing test, in fact I was about to comment the
test out and return to it in a follow up ticket but then I did one last google
search and stumbled upon
[this stackoverflow result](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63006476/fireevent-change-does-not-toggle-checkbox),
linked from there was this issue comment noting that for checkbox elements, we
actually want to fire a `click` event instead of a `change` event!

So I went back to my test and updated it one last time to the following:

```jsx
const handleChange = jest.fn();
render(<CheckboxTable onChange={handleChange} />);

fireEvent.click(screen.getByTestId('header-checkbox'));

expect(handleChange).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);
```

and the test started passing!
