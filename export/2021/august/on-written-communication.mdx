I've been noodling on this topic for a while, and I realized as I was walking
home earlier today that it clicked for me.

One of the things that I've been finding myself really missing as of late at
work is a platform for communication that encourages longer form written
content. Slack, our defacto default communication tool, has simultaneously been
one of the best things and the worst things for team communication and
collaboration. It's difficult for me to accurately describe my mixed emotions
about it in writing<FootnoteRef id="1" />.

I think I've partially started to really feel this since I've been diving deep
into tools for thought like Obsidian and Roam, which have really encouraged me
to think by writing. I've found it incredibly freeing to brain dump my thoughts
on a topic, and it has helped me make connections that I might have otherwise
lost to random thoughts before getting distracted by something else.

However, I don't really have an equivalent for communication, or more
specifically I feel like I'm missing the Obsidian vault that I could use to
~~collaborate with~~ _think with_ teammates<FootnoteRef id="2" />. While
internally at work we do have tools like Google Docs, Confluence, etc, none of
these tools seemed to have really stuck, and they either lean too heavily into
one side of the spectrum between collaboration or permanence.

I don't know if I necessarily have a point or takeaway with this blog post,
however I do think there is value in defaulting to longer form communication. It
does have trade offs, usually in both more investment for writing and reading,
however it can also shorten an otherwise lengthy discussion of back and forth
slack messages into a single concise read.

that are entirely custom!</Footnote>

<Footnote id="2">I'd be really curious to test this out at some point, or even
to hear from folks that have tried a similar setup to see how it's worked or not
worked!</Footnote>
