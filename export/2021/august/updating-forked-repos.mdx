I find myself reaching for forked repos more often than direct clones these
days, however I always inevitably need to find a way to update my fork based on
the original repo. I usually google the answer and find a helpful stack overflow
that has the code that I need.

I figured I'd re-share that here both as a personal reference to the snippet of
code and if others want to find it as well.

```bash
# First add the original repo as a remote locally
# here we call that one `upstream`
git remote add upstream <link-to-original-repo>

# Fetch that upstream repo to ensure we have the latest references
git fetch upstream

# Checkout the main branch
git checkout main

# Apply the commits from upstream main to the local main branch
git rebase upstream/main

# Finally push this back up to the forked remote
git push origin main
```
