A decent part of my day-to-day work is iterating on solving UI "problems" by
using <Link to="/blog/2021/november/fast-feedback-systems">fast feedback
systems</Link>, such as web sandboxes / REPLs like
[CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io). As I iterate on these UI challenges, I
tend to want to both look at the UI and also see a feed of the Console from
devtools without the rest of the devtools panel taking up space on the screen.

To solve this use case I threw together a quick and dirty `useConsole` hook that
can capture the output of `console.log` calls and then pipe that into some
element that can be rendered on top of the UI.

```tsx
export function useConsole() {
  let [content, setContent] = useState('');
  useLayoutEffect(() => {
    let originalConsole = console.log;
    console.log = (...message) => {
      setContent((content) => {
        return `> ${message.join(' ')}${content ? `\n${content}` : ''}`;
      });
      originalConsole(...message);
    };
  }, []);
  return content;
}
```

### Usage:

```tsx
function Root() {
  let content = useConsole();

  return (
    <>
      <Box is='pre' position='absolute' top={4} right={4} width={300}>
        {content}
      </Box>
      <App />
    </>
  );
}
```

### Notes:

This hook only overrides `console.log`, if you want to catch other console
methods than you'll want to modify the `useEffect` body.

Additionally, this should be run as early as possible in the render of the
component to catch all calls to `console.log`

> ⚠️ Be careful using this hook and calling `console.log` from within render, as
> it will cause an infinite render loop!
