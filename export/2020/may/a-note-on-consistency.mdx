When distributing work across a team of individuals, the most important process
to nail down is communication, however the second most important process to
focus on is consistency.

The reason that consistency is so important when working with other team members
is that it scales and distributes cognitive load and historical context across
the team. This distribution only happens if the team solidifies their
discoveries and solutions as patterns that everyone else can learn from.

The benefit of consistency is that new team members don’t need to ask why when
they implement a shared pattern in their work. Note that asking why for new
patterns is still incredibly valuable, and great teams often invest in great
documentation around the reasoning behind their patterns to help answer the why
questions, however an individual doesn’t need to ask why when following
consistent patterns in their work.
