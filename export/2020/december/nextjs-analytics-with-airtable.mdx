I was recently looking for a quick and easy solution to track page hits on my
personal site for another small feature add to the site (blog post on that when
I get around to it!), and figured that I could probably spin up something very
low-fidelity using [NextJS](https://nextjs.org)'s `/api` routes and
[Airtable](https://airtable.com).

To get started, you'll want to create a new `Base` on Airtable, and a new table
within that. I opted to use an empty base as the starting point.

Inside the new table created, I'd recommend making the following changes:

1. Rename the table, it starts off named as `'Table 1'` which isn't all that
   easy to find, I called mine `page-hits`
2. Set the primary column to something unique, I opted to name it `id` and set
   the type to `Autonumber` so I don't need to worry about conflicts
3. Set the second column to be the `url` that the user is visiting
4. Add a third column to track "hit counts" (each record will only have a value
   of 1 here, I use this to automatically rely on Airtable's Sum feature on
   columns), I called mine `hits`

Once you have your Airtable base and table setup, head over to
[`api.airtable.com`](https://api.airtable.com), and select the base that you
just created.

From there, you'll want to change the right-hand-side code preview to
JavaScript, and select "Show API key"

For now, grab your api key and now jump to your NextJS project.

> Note: This guide assumes you have a NextJS project up and running already, and
> you at least know of `/api` routes

Within your NextJS project, if you don't yet have a `.env.local` file at the
root of the project then create one, and add a new line that has some unique
all-capitilized key name for the Airtable API key:

```bash
AIRTABLE_API_KEY=your-key-here
```

> Replace `your-key-here` from the above snippet with the API key from the above
> Airtable api page

Next, you'll want to setup the api route that you will log to from the frontend
of your site, for my site I named it `pages/api/record-page.ts`, but you can
call it whatever!

Then you'll need to install the `airtable` NPM package:

```bash
yarn add airtable
```

Within the newly created api file, you'll need to import the airtable package:

```tsx
import airtable from 'airtable'
```

and configure it with your API key and create the base:

```tsx
airtable.configure({
  apiKey: process.env.AIRTABLE_API_KEY,
})

let base = airtable.base('your-base-id')
```

> You can find the base-id from the [Airtable API](https://api.airtable.com)
> page

Now you'll want to create the function that will handle the request from the
frontend:

```tsx
export default function handler(req, res) {
  let body = JSON.parse(req.body)

  // Handle local dev reporting
  if (body.url.includes('localhost')) {
    res.statusCode = 200
    res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json')
    res.end(JSON.stringify({ skipped: true }))
    return
  }

  // handle creating the record on airtable
  base('your-table-name')
    .create([
      {
        fields: {
          // pass the url
          url: body.url,
          // and set the hits to 1
          hit: 1,
        },
      },
    ])
    .catch((err) => {
      console.error(err)
    })

  res.statusCode = 200
  res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json')
  res.end(JSON.stringify({ success: true }))
}
```

and that's it for the server-side code you need to create!

Finally, to use this api route you need to add some code to your `_app.tsx`
file:

```tsx
// Import the next router
import Router from 'next/router'

Router.events.on('routeChangeComplete', () => {
  fetch('/api/<your-api-route>', {
    body: JSON.stringify({
      // pass the current url to the api route
      url: window.location.href,
    }),
  })
})
```

This code will add an event listener to the Next Router that will be called when
the user has finished a client-side route change between pages.

In addition to the code above, you'll also want to handle tracking fresh page
hits:

```tsx
// still within _app.tsx
import { useEffect } from 'react'

export default function App() {
  // ...

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch('/api/<your-api-route>', {
      body: JSON.stringify({
        // pass the current url to the api route
        url: window.location.href,
      }),
    })
  }, [])

  // ...
}
```

That should be it! With the above configured, you should now be able to see
Airtable records created when a visitor lands on one of the routes for your
NextJS site! Let me know what you thought about this blog post by
