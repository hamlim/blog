Both at work and in my free time I've been working on an online browser-based
live sandbox for interpreting JavaScript code and rendering output using React.
Very much like tools such as [Codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/),
[CodePen](https://codepen.io), or the variety of other online REPLs.

Since I've been exploring this concept for a bit of time I figured I would try
to write about some of my learnings and tips and tricks for others that might be
interested.

To start off, I figured I'd share the high level concepts for building a sandbox
for the browser. At a super high level, you'll need:

- An editor component
- A preview component

A very basic implementation of this, expressed as a React component, might look
something like this:

```tsx
export default function Sandbox() {
  let [code, setCode] = useState(`
render(
  createElement('h1', {}, 'Hello World!'),
  rootElement
)`);

  let [rootElement, setRootElement] = useState();

  useEffect(() => {
    if (!rootElement) {
      return;
    }

    let func = new Function(
      'React',
      'createElement',
      'render',
      'rootElement',
      code,
    );

    func(React, React.createElement, ReactDOM.render, rootElement);
  }, [code, rootElement]);

  return (
    <>
      <label>
        Code:
        <textarea
          value={code}
          onChange={(e) => {
            setCode(e.target.value);
          }}
        />
      </label>
      <div ref={setRootElement} />
    </>
  );
}
```

So let's break down the above code snippet a bit to better understand what is
happening.

Our first concept from above was a code editor, in our above snippet the
following code is playing that role of the code editor (managing the state and
rendering the text editor using a `textarea`):

```tsx
// ==highlight== 1-5,27-35
export default function Sandbox() {
  let [code, setCode] = useState(`
render(
  createElement('h1', {}, 'Hello World!'),
  rootElement
)`);

  let [rootElement, setRootElement] = useState();

  useEffect(() => {
    if (!rootElement) {
      return;
    }

    let func = new Function(
      'React',
      'createElement',
      'render',
      'rootElement',
      code,
    );

    func(React, React.createElement, ReactDOM.render, rootElement);
  }, [code, rootElement]);

  return (
    <>
      <label>
        Code:
        <textarea
          value={code}
          onChange={(e) => {
            setCode(e.target.value);
          }}
        />
      </label>
      <div ref={setRootElement} />
    </>
  );
}
```

The second concept noted from above is the preview component of the system, in
this example the preview component is highlighted below (including the system
that transforms the code that the user authors, and evaluating that code):

```tsx highlight=7,9-23,36
export default function Sandbox() {
  let [code, setCode] = useState(`
render(
  createElement('h1', {}, 'Hello World!'),
  rootElement
)`);

  let [rootElement, setRootElement] = useState();

  useEffect(() => {
    if (!rootElement) {
      return;
    }

    let func = new Function(
      'React',
      'createElement',
      'render',
      'rootElement',
      code,
    );

    func(React, React.createElement, ReactDOM.render, rootElement);
  }, [code, rootElement]);

  return (
    <>
      <label>
        Code:
        <textarea
          value={code}
          onChange={(e) => {
            setCode(e.target.value);
          }}
        />
      </label>
      <div ref={setRootElement} />
    </>
  );
}
```

Again, this snippet is a pretty basic example of a sandbox REPL in the browser,
however there are several opportunities for enhancement here:

- We render the preview in-line with the rest of the page, however if we wanted
  to truly sandbox _no pun intended_ the preview, we should move it over into an
  iframe
- We assume that the browser can understand the code that the user writes, but
  what about experimental syntax options or extensions like JSX?
- We hardcode the scope that the code inside the editor can access via our
  `new Function` call, but ideally we'd like to support the user to specify what
  code they would like to load in the preview
- A textarea isn't exactly the best code editing experience for developers, you
  miss out on convinience features that any developers are use to with their
  current code editors

In future versions of this blog post I'll dive into these points and more to see
how we can enhance this development experience! If you have comments or
