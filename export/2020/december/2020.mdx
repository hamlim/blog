Whew, what a year, 2020 has been quite a rough year.

<Spacer />

I could probably wrap up my year in review blog post with just the line above
but I figured it's probably more cathartic to dive into what this year has been
like for me.

### January

Even before Covid was a very big thing in the US, I started the year off by
wrapping up an extended Christmas and New Years vacation back home in Washington
state. I had been feeling a bit out of sorts for the two or three weeks around
the end of December and didn't feel any better at the turn of the new year.

I ended up going to the walk in clinic after I got back to Boston (around the
21st) and they rushed me off to the hospital (or rather told me to go there
immediately). I ended up staying in the hospital for about 3 days.

I was diagnosed with Diabetic Ketoacidosis, with a blood sugar reading of just
above 500!

> For those that don't know, a usual healthy blood sugar reading is around
> 80-120

Ultimately, I was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes, and was told by several
doctors that I needed to get this under control. I'm immensely thankful to my
parents and grandmother for flying out to Boston to stay with me while I was in
the hospital and as I got re-adjusted back into my regular life.

Thanks to the new diagnosis I had a whole suite of prescriptions that I needed
to take, including insulin. Outside of my diagnosis, January was pretty quiet.

### February

Most of February was filled with me still adjusting to my recent health scare.
About mid-way through February, Wayfair underwent it's own change.

Around early February, Wayfair (where I worked) announced that we we're letting
go of a decent chunk of the folks that worked across the company. Many of the
folks that I had worked with in the past were unfortunately being laid off.

This was a pretty big change, through my history at Wayfair we had never had
large layoffs, and in many ways it was a first for the rest of the organization
as well.

Myself and my direct team were thankfully not impacted, but our partnering teams
were unfortunately hit.

### March

There's not too much to call out about March, I think most readers (at least
those in the US) know that this was when the beginning of the Covid stay at home
/ quarantine started for most folks.

At Wayfair we started it as a two day (Thursday and Friday)
"trial"<FootnoteRef id="1" />, and then ballooned to the end of 2020 through to
June of 2021 at the time of writing.

For most of March, I ended up working from my studio apartment, fashioning a
hacky standing desk by setting my laptop on a folding chair that was set on top
of my desk<FootnoteRef id="2" />.

### April: aka March 2 - June

These months all blended together quite a bit for me, working 10 hours a day or
so all from my apartment, and barely leaving my apartment for anything besides a
weekly grocery run.

It wasn't until June that anything really notably changed for me, given that our
date by which we were expected to return to the office got pushed back from July
to January, my parents convinced me to fly back out to Washington to work from
home.

I took them up on the offer and have been working from Washington since then!

### July

During the month of July, my parents and I started work on tearing down the
existing deck on the house to build a new one. This work ended up taking almost
two full months to complete.

During July, my parents and I took a few weekend drives up and around
Leavenworth and Wenatchee.

### August

August was pretty similar to July, the notable events for me was visiting Mount
Rainier National Park with my family as well as taking a trip over to Winthrop
Washington.

#### Rainier

In addition to the above two trips, we also took some time to go camping up at
LaConner Washington, and enjoyed a few hikes up there as well as some delicious
fish and chips!

### September

We finally finished the new back deck on the house in September!

### October

On yet another trip, this time with just my parents, we went over to Wenatchee
to stay for a night and do a few hikes around the area.

### November

November proved to bring an interesting Thanksgiving, usually for Thanksgiving
we invite over several members of the family to our house to have a nice large
dinner. Due to Covid however, we opted for smaller, yet still traditional
Thanksgiving dinner with our close family.

To wrap up November, my parents and I took a drive up to Baring Washington, and
went on a hike up to Baring Lake. The whole trail we had to scramble over large
trees that had fallen across the trail, sometimes proving to be pretty difficult
to cross over. However the views were totally worth it!

### December

To wrap up this really wonky year, December has been remarkably average for me.
Our Christmas was pretty laid back this year, obviously skipping the usual get
together (like we did for Thanksgiving dinner).

<Spacer />

I still have a lot of questions about what my life will look like as we go into
2021, but I feel like I've gotten over the worst of it through this year. Not
only with Covid in the US, but also my personal health and my journey so far
with diabetes.

I started off this blog post thinking that I would generally try to tease out a
point that would make the year make sense and I had thought it was going to be
something that was very negative, but as I got into it I found myself scrolling
through hundreds of pictures that I took over the past 6+ months and
surprisingly really enjoyed the memories of this year.

While this was a very rough year, I'm leaving it behind even more thankful of my
close family and friends who have been there for me when I needed them the most.
