I've been spending a bit more time than usual in the past two or so weeks on my
side projects. For those that know me personally, I used to really enjoy
spending time working on open source projects in my free time. However, over the
past 9 or so months I have been feeling a bit burnt out on the code and couldn't
muster the energy to open VSCode to work on some projects.

As of late however that energy is beginning to come back to me bit by bit. It
might be because I am writing far less code at work than I used to many months
ago, or it might just be that I am working my way out of the boredom.

With this revitalization of my side projects, I have found that I can no longer
ship projects. Back in college I was able to sit down for a solid three day
weekend and just churn out working websites (sure the code was pretty bad, but
the features worked!). Now days I can barely ship something usable, let alone
something complete that I would feel comfortable announcing to the world.

I think the key reason that has held me back from shipping new features or
projects is what I like to call _The Rabbit Hole_. Its the tendency for a
developer to go deeper and depper in the meta of trying to solve their issue at
hand.

For example, I started off by wanting to implement a simple todo application
that has some pretty neat features, however as I began work I realized I wanted
to work on a customized component library so the application UI was really nice.
So I started work on my own component library as a separate project. As that
work began I realized I needed to work on building out some tooling for the
monorepo that I keep the code within so I started yet another project to help me
automate tasks around the repo (this monorepo now has well over 20 packages
now).

Its now 3 months later and I still don't have a working todo application, but
that original project has expanding its scope so far that I am building a
general hub site that tracks todos, health, financials, habits, and a general
calendar.

This is The Rabbit Hole, a deep and complex waste of time preventing me from
actually shipping.
