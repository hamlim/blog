My feelings on meetings (either in person or virtual) are a constant pendulum.
When the meeting has clear value for me, I at best don't get disinterested by
them and have the semblance of feeling productive. However, if there is limited
percieved value for me in the meeting, I leave feeling drained of yet another
hour in a shorter and shorter day.

I've found that a more useful tool for making a decision has become the good old
shared doc (currently Google Docs has become my go to at work because of how
easy it is to create and share).

I use free-form docs to brain-dump everything I know about a specific topic when
I need to make a decision, I then refine those thoughts, groom through them,
share the doc for early feedback with coworkers, then I edit the doc and clearly
outline the decision and share once more.

For me, this format is driving a shift of decision making processes from being
synchronous by default to being asynchronous by default.
