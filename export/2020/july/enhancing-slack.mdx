I've been using Slack a lot recently, although to be honest I have always used
Slack a lot, but it feels like I'm using it more than normal since Wayfair
started it's work from home period. I've probably put in ~8 hours in the app
(Mac and Android apps combined) every week-day for the past few months ðŸ˜±.

While using the app as much as I have been in the past few months, I've stumbled
upon a few enhancements that I think would really improve my workflow and allow
me to be more productive<FootnoteRef id="1" />. I've broken these down into four
specific features I would like to see:

- Automatic Timezone Conversion
- Channel Bundles
- Saved Channel Filters
- A "Previously Read" view

### Automatic Timezone Conversion

Even more recently than the beginning of our work-from-home period, I decided to
fly back out to the west coast and work from my parents home for a little while,
so far it's been a really great experience! One of the things I have found
myself doing in the middle of messaging my teammates however is doing the
timezone conversion in my head and writing out both times.

For example, if I was talking with a teammate to schedule a meeting, I'll
generally say something like

> Does 3pm EST (12pm PST) work for you?

When in reality, what I really want to do is just message them the propsed time
in _my_ timezone and have Slack do the heavy lifting of converting that to my
teammates timezone.

I imagine the other person seeing the time formatted for their timezone, and
maybe a tooltip that they can hover over to see the time in my timezone. This
would be such a small feature, but would really make the experience for teams
that are distributed across multiple timezones and across the globe!

### Channel Bundles

If you're anything like me, you happen to be in hundereds of Slack channels,
some of them are closely related and others are wildly different. Since the
[addition of sections](https://slackhq.com/simpler-more-organized-slack) in the
UI, I've been grouping these channels together which has been really great.
However, if there are updates across several related channels I have to either
scroll through my All Unread view to find them all, or click into each channel
individually.

After thinking about this ~~problem~~ _minor inconvenience_ for a bit, the best
idea that I had could best be described by channel bundles. I'm envisioning that
this could look like a "super-channel", where I can choose to group all the
threads and messages from several channels and display them in a single
chronological view.

This could be just an unread view that is filled with specific channels instead
of showing the full history - either way this would allow me to easily see the
general discussion happening across related channels easily.

### Saved Channel Filters

Several teams in Wayfair use `-feed` or `-update` Slack channels to share
automated or manual release notes for a wide audience. Something that our team
has been balancing is the number of these channels we post to and the variety of
information we share. We might post updates for a new library release that is
most pertiant to one audience and then post another release that is more
pertiant to a completely different audience.

To aid with this, it would be neat for Slack to support saved filters on
specific channels, or even across multiple channels. Kind of like a continuous,
pinned search result across the workspace. I think something like this could be
accomplished via using keywords and following them in the messages and reactions
view - but if your team uses emoji like Wayfair does that view gets drowned out
with a ton of reactions.

To take this to another level, imagine being able to share these saved filters,
maybe even having a workflow share them when new folks join a channel!

### Previously Read

If I had a penny for every time that I accidentally, and unintentionally, marked
a message as read and then completely forgot about it I think I would be able to
buy Slack outright ðŸ˜‚ It would be great to scroll back through a chronological
feed of my past unreads and notifications in a single view, and then easily mark
conversations as unread.

I really wish every application offered this kind of git-like history view of
notifications!

I don't expect the above ideas to ever make their way into the Slack
application, but if you are a PM, or an engineer, or a designer working at Slack
and want to chat more about any of the above then definitely hit me up! What
other features would you like to see added to Slack?
