This weekend I set out to work on Bundles and to also work on my own website. I
successfully launched Bundles v1, setup a blog on my website, redesigned my
portfolio, and now I have finished redesigning my resume website also

The new cleaner resume focuses on just the key areas of my technical resume,
allowing potential employers to find what they need to know about me without
needing to sort through tons of unrelated content.

This weekend over all served as a great experiment in learning new technologies
(Jekyll) and also in learning a new framework to build sites on.

Hopefully I spend more weekends working on these side projects and launching
things more often. On my schedule for Christmas day however is a fully working
version of Bundles, or at least the core requirements.

Honestly though I wish I didn't have to go back to classes for three weeks and
wish I could spend more time just on development.
