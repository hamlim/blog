Since I came home for Thanksgiving I figured I would have enough time to get
away from pesky homework assignments and projects and spend some time not only
with my family but also working on some of my own projects. The first was
building and launching Bundles version 1, the second was launching this blog,
and the third is reworking my portfolio website.

My old portfolio website used to load in an image from Unsplash on the left
sidebar. The problem was that every time that I pulled up my site and others
pulled up my site that image would take forever to load. It would end up making
my site look ridiculously terrible, especially since I am looking for front end
web development opportunities.

So I decided to change that and completely change my portfolio website in the
process, I dropped the slow framework I was using for a simpler one (currently
using [skeleton css](http://getskeleton.com/)) I also dropped a lot of the
unnecessary content that was on my portfolio website.

That above is what my current portfolio website looks like, its simple, clean
and loads far quicker than my previous website.

The next project I plan on finishing up this weekend is changing my resume
website over to the Skeleton framework as well.
