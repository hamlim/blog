This week(end) for me has been an amazing whirlwind of fun times with family
members. Coming home this weekend has been in the works since mid September and
up until the time I arrived only a total of 8 people and only 2 family members
knew I was coming home.

Since Freshman year at RPI I had always wanted to find a way to sneak home
during one of my breaks to surprise my family and I was fortunate enough to come
home for Thanksgiving this year to surprise most of my family.

Saving time for family when pressured to complete work or school tasks is
important, not only to give yourself a break but also to sit back an enjoy life
with those around you. My blog post on Thanksgiving day expanded more about how
thankful I am for those around me, but I am also really glad that I can be
spoiled with all this time to be around my family.

No matter what you do during the year, the holidays are always the best time to
take a rest and spend time with your loved ones.
