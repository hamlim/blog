From November 25th to December 1st I was posting a blog update once a day, I
unfortunately didn't post yesterday however. I realized something yesterday,
while I was posting these blog updates I figured that each post was like doing
the same kind of work on a project, yet they aren't the same as doing work on a
project. They have been acting as time sinks draining all m time and efforts
that I could be putting towards working on Bundles or other school related
projects.

So I took yesterday off, and I focused on school work, and from here on out I
only plan on writing a post when I have something I need to say or for updates
about my projects.
