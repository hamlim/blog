A few days ago I tweeted about an idea I had on social networking. I tweeted
saying that there is a a maximum limit on the number of social networks someone
is willing to keep up to date. I feel like this number is independent from
person to person, so there will be people who can manage 5, 10 or even 15 social
networks and others who can only manage one or two.

The question arrises, is the social network startup market oversaturated? There
are hundreds of social networks out there and more seem to always be entering
the app stores, however have people already met their social max with the apps
they have already? There is always a possibility that these new social apps will
sometimes replace another but most social apps try to aim at a new killer
feature/focus.

The most recent example of this is the app called Beme that I have been using
here and there for the past few weeks. Unfortunately whenever I use it I never
really feel like I want to share with the app. It just hasn't clicked for me to
be one of the apps I go to to share a moment.

I currently only manage probably 3 social apps at any given time, these apps I
have used for a while and I have heavily invested time in both sharing and
curating the right network to share to. Other apps that are built on their own
network (not using Facebook or Twitter login/account making) are far more
difficult to invest the same amount of time that I spent on my current networks.

Ultimately I believe that the social app market is oversaturated, but only for
the non-current generation, I feel that as another generation comes along they
will be more willing to use more social apps as they want to share more of their
lives with others. Let me know what you think about the social max and if it
changes at all as a generation gets older.
