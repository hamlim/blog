Over the past week or so I start to finally experiment with Yarn v3, a few years
back I tried out Yarn v2 and ran into a ton of issues (anyone else remember that
Yarn needed to patch a ton of tooling to just work?!). I figured they had ironed
out some of those issues by v3 and that maybe it was time to replace my yarn v1
installation and try it out.

Unfortunately, it still seems pretty clunky, not too many tools in the ecosystem
seem to support it still (for example it seems Vercel still uses Yarn v1 during
deploys), so I decided to give up on Yarn and switch over to PNPM.

We've been using PNPM at work for a few new repos and while it has some unique
approaches to module installation and setup, it seems to be pretty quick and
easy to use.

I will say, the v6 to v7 changes seem pretty intense (I've already noticed some
projects work only with PNPM v6), but overall I've been enjoying PNPM! Now time
for me to get back and update all my side projects again ðŸ™ƒ.
