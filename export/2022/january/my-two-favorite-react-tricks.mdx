There are generally two rarely used patterns in React that I really enjoy
getting to use in applications that I work on.

These both are:

- Using `key`
- Throwing within a state setter

## On `Key`

In React, `key` is one of those early concepts that you learn that seems to only
be documented for use within lists. However it is an incredibly useful feature
that most developers don't use when building applications!

If you ever find yourself realizing that you need to reset the state, or refs,
of a particular component based on some value in the parent a `key` that can be
changed on the component is a really useful way to do so!

I've generally recommended this for updating components that may perform some
computation when the component mounts, but doesn't re-compute that operation at
a later point in time.

```tsx
<Child key={someCondition ? 'a' : 'b'} />
```

## Throwing Within A State Setter

I've written about this concept briefly in my post on
[React Error Boundaries](/blog/2019/january/react-error-boundaries#caveat),
however I figured I'd write about the concept in another post since I really
enjoy this feature.

If you ever find yourself wanting to trigger an error boundary from an event
handler, or even an asynchronous function call (e.g. within a promise callback,
or another microtask), you can call a `setState` function with a function that
throws in the body!

```diff
function handleClick() {
  try {
    // do some logic
  } catch (error) {
-     // How do I trigger an error boundary here?
+     setState(() => {
+       throw error;
+     });
  }
}
```

I use this pattern so often that I usually add a `useErrorBoundary` hook in most
of my side projects:

```tsx
import { useState } from 'react'

export default function useErrorBoundary() {
  let [, set] = useState()
  return (error) =>
    set(() => {
      throw error
    })
}
// in another file...
function Component() {
  let trigger = useErrorBoundary()

  function handleClick() {
    trigger(new Error('Yo!'))
  }
  //...
}
```
