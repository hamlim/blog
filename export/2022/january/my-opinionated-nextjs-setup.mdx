_I've since updated this blog post [here](/blog/2022/december/updated-opinionated-nextjs-setup)_

As I've been hacking on a recent
[side project](https://github.com/hamlim/watch-list), I've started to form some
loose opinions on my ideal Next.js application structure. Some of these opinions
are strongly held, and others are still forming and I expect will change in the
future, however I wanted to document them here to see if others have built up
similar application code structures!

1. Nest code within a `src` directory

This one is fairly basic, however it aligns with my personal need to keep
codebases relatively well organized without too much clutter at the root of the
repository / project root.

2. Group code into the following folders:

```sh
src/
  components/
  pages/
  views/
  utils/ (optional)
  hooks/ (optional)
```

This structure allows me to easily split off some piece of code into a easily
identifiable location within the project, without adding too much ceremony to
creating new files. I still strongly feel that code shouldn't be split out to
new files when one file gets a bit too long however! (My ideal application would
have all the code live within a single file, and then let my IDE "slice" that
file up into easily viewable and editable windows)

Both the `utils` and `hooks` folders are optional, however I will generally want
to stay away from having any files within this `src` directory **not** in one of
the above folders.

3. Keep files in `pages/` minimal (Still feeling this one out)

I've included a `views/` folder above to help capture any top level application
views, the beauty of this structure is that it allows me to colocate styles
(since I'm leveraging [`vanilla-extract`](https://vanilla-extract.style/) these
days) along with any tests if I ever find myself wanting to write unit tests.

This one I haven't really given much thought to however, I don't know the right
point to allow some composition within the file in `pages/` vs the right amount
left in the `views/` files.
