I was talking with my manager the other day about validating my own thinking,
and he shared a remarkably simple note that felt really crucial:

> Just write it down

A good old Google Doc (or Notion page) is such an incredible tool for validating
a line of thinking. It allows you to clarify all the nitty gritty details that
are locked away in your head, and also begin to highlight the areas that you
haven't started to think about yet as well!

This is something that I've been generally doing for a while (I've written quite
a bit about my own note taking systems), but it's something I overlook quite
often also. Usually it feels like I don't have time to get my thinking down on
(digital) paper. Maybe that's the key point here though, slow down the thinking
enough to clearly write down my thoughts and validate them as I'm doing that.
