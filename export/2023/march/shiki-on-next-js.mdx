I recently updated how I handle syntax highlighting within code blocks on my
personal site here. After my recent refactor a few months ago, I had adopted
`highlight.js` originally but then only recently realized that it still doesn't
support JSX/TSX syntax highlighting.

I did some googling around, almost went down the path of using Prism.js as well,
and then remembered that [`shiki`](https://shiki.matsu.io/) exists and decided
to give it a try.

Originally, I thought it was going to be pretty easy, or at least it was easy to
implement for local development within my React Server Component setup for my
blog. It was only when I went to deploy it that it started to break.

I ran into the following error and was a bit confused on what it meant:

```sh
[Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/var/task/node_modules/shiki/languages/typescript.tmLanguage.json'] {
  errno: -2,
  code: 'ENOENT',
  syscall: 'open',
  path: '/var/task/node_modules/shiki/languages/typescript.tmLanguage.json'
```

It turns out that by default, Next.js doesn't bundle in `shiki`, which means
there's a raw `require` or dynamic import for the text grammars and the themes.

After stumbling across a few different issues, each with different ways to
resolve the problem I was running into, I found the following solution:

1. Import the themes and grammars that are needed manually
2. Pass them directly into the `highlight` call

Here's a complete example of my current CodeBlock component:

```tsx
import shiki from 'shiki';

// Manually import themes and grammars
import cssGrammar from 'shiki/languages/css.tmLanguage.json';
import diffGrammar from 'shiki/languages/diff.tmLanguage.json';
import jsonGrammar from 'shiki/languages/json.tmLanguage.json';
import mdGrammar from 'shiki/languages/markdown.tmLanguage.json';
import bashGrammar from 'shiki/languages/shellscript.tmLanguage.json';
import tsxGrammar from 'shiki/languages/tsx.tmLanguage.json';
import githubDarkDimmed from 'shiki/themes/github-dark-dimmed.json';
import githubLight from 'shiki/themes/github-light.json';

export default async function CodeBlock({ children, className, ...props }) {
  let lang = className ? className.split('-')[1] : 'typescript';
  if (lang === 'tsx' || lang === 'jsx' || lang === 'js') {
    lang = 'typescript';
  } else if (lang === 'sh') {
    lang = 'bash';
  }

  let codeToHighlight = children;

  let highlighter = await shiki.getHighlighter({
    // Pass in manually imported themes and grammars
    // @ts-ignore
    themes: [githubDarkDimmed, githubLight],
    langs: [
      // @ts-ignore
      { id: 'tsx', scopeName: 'source.tsx', grammar: tsxGrammar },
      // @ts-ignore
      { id: 'typescript', scopeName: 'source.tsx', grammar: tsxGrammar },
      // @ts-ignore
      { id: 'md', scopeName: 'text.html.markdown', grammar: mdGrammar },
      // @ts-ignore
      { id: 'css', scopeName: 'source.css', grammar: cssGrammar },
      // @ts-ignore
      { id: 'diff', scopeName: 'source.diff', grammar: diffGrammar },
      // @ts-ignore
      { id: 'bash', scopeName: 'source.shell', grammar: bashGrammar },
      // @ts-ignore
      { id: 'json', scopeName: 'source.json', grammar: jsonGrammar },
    ],
  });

  let html = highlighter.codeToHtml(codeToHighlight, { lang });

  return (
    <Box
      is='code'
      dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: html }}
      {...props}
      className={className ? `${className} ${code}` : `${code}`}
    />
  );
}
```

For some reason, shiki's TypeScript types don't seem to like me passing in the
themes or the grammars manually, so I opted to ts-ignore those errors for the
time being ðŸ™‚.

Hopefully this helps others that might run into the same issue!
