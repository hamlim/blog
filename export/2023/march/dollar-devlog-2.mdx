This post is a continuation of my first Dollar Devlog
[here](/blog/2023/january/dollar-devlog-1).

It's been a bit since the last devlog, life has generally got in the way (work
more-so than anything else), however this weekend I was able to spend quite a
bit of time working on Dollar again.

I've made some changes since the last devlog, but still nothing publically
available to showcase just yet!

Primarily, this Saturday I started off by forking my component library
(`@ds-pack/components`) into a new package that completely swaps out Vanilla
Extract for TailwindCSS (using [`daisyui`](https://daisyui.com/)). For those of
you that know me, you might be a bit surprised that I decided to try out
tailwind, I've frequently referred to it as "bootstrapcss for the modern age",
yet ironically - that's exactly what I've been looking for as of late.

I don't intend to fully dig into that transition in this post (I might blog
about it in another post however), but the main reason that I opted to switch
was that I wanted to tear down how my css build pipeline works in most of my
modern Next.js applications. I've written about that in my
[opinionated Next.js app setup](/blog/2022/december/updated-opinionated-nextjs-setup)
blog post, but the gist is that having two process running at once to compile
styles and run the app was a pain and let to a ton of issues when iteratively
updating styles.

Daisyui seemed like a good option, and really all I wanted was a React version
of it - which I felt like `@ds-pack/components` was a good bare bones React
component library to fit that need. I've published a very early version of the
library as `@ds-pack/daisyui`, feel free to check it out if you want to
experiment with the library in your own side project! (I do plan to refactor my
personal site with this version of my components, but that might take a while to
fully implement)

Alright, back to my work on Dollar, I haven't made much progress because of the
effort required to build the new UI library (although completeing it in the span
of an afternoon was pretty sweet).

Outside of the new coat of paint, I've been able to:

- Fully integrate React Server Components
- Experiment with Server Actions (more on this below)
- Begin to wire up supabase as the DB for the project

### Server Actions

Alright, I know server actions are still super early, but they're kind of
promising. Being able to do remote procedure calls within React is pretty dope!

For those that don't know, that roughly looks like the following:

```tsx
// some client code, like a form!
'use client';

import { login } from './actions';

export default function Form() {
  return (
    <form>
      <input name='email' type='text' />
      <button
        type='button'
        onClick={async () => {
          let userToken = await login({
            email: document.getElementsByName('email')[0].value,
          });
          // do what you want with userToken here!
        }}
      >
        Login!
      </button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

You might be thinking, that doesn't seem too cool, we've been doing that for
years, `login` from `./actions` could just be a wrapper around a `fetch()` call!

Here's the cool thing, it is, but I don't have to do all the complext work of
wiring up that `fetch` call, here's the full code of `./actions`:

```tsx
// new directive!
'use server';

export async function login({ email }) {
  // do something to login the user
  return userToken;
}
```

The really neat thing here is that React / Next are doing the heavy lifting for
me to do the `fetch` call in the background!

There are some limitations however, e.g. for logging in a user I'd probably want
to store a JWT as a cookie, unfortunately I don't have access to the raw
`Request` and also I'm not able to send a raw `Response` back to the client - so
I'd probably still want to reach for Next.js `routes` to support some of those
use cases.

None the less, this is still a pretty neat pattern that I plan on exploring more
as I get deeper into the project!
