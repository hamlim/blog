I've started to use [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) with my personal
projects as a replacement for [Vanilla Extract](https://vanilla-extract.style/),
and I've found myself copying my tailwind settings/setup across a few different
projects as I'm refreshing their setups.

Since I often need to jump back into the Tailwind docs and find their Next.js
setup instructions I figured I'd share my settings here (some of which might be
opinionated), which should make it easier to run this process in different
projects.

### 1. Install Dependencies:

```sh
yarn add tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer daisyui @ds-pack/daisyui
```

### 2. Setup Tailwind Config:

Create the following `tailwind.config.js` file:

```tsx
let path = require('path');

module.exports = {
  content: [
    './app/**/*.tsx',
    './lib/**/*.tsx',
    './ui/**/*.tsx',
    path.join(
      path.dirname(require.resolve('@ds-pack/daisyui')),
      '/**/*.js',
    ),
  ],
  plugins: [require('@tailwindcss/typography'), require('daisyui')],
  daisyui: {
    logs: false,
  },
};
```

### 3. Run the Tailwind Setup Script:

```sh
yarn dlx tailwindcss init -p
```

### 4. Configre Base Styles

Create a new `globals.css` file within the `styles/` directory with the below
content:

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

and then import that in your root `layout.tsx` file:

```tsx
import '@styles/globals.css';
```

### All Done!

With the above, the application should be setup with Tailwind,
[Daisyui](https://daisyui.com/), and
[`@ds-pack/daisyui`](https://github.com/ds-pack/components/tree/main/packages/daisyui).
I'll update my opinionated Next.js setup blog post with these details soon also!
