For a while now I've been pretty dismissive of
[TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), usually brushing it off as yet another
BootstrapCSS alternative. However, I've started using it in several of my side
projects and I think I've changed some of my opinions on it as a tool.

## Background:

Before using Tailwind, I was using Vanilla Extract, and before that was using
Styled Components. I pivoted from each tool to the next one because of other
technical limitations. In the case of the change from Styled Components to
Vanilla Extract it was because I wanted to move away from runtime styling
solutions (partially to prepare for React Server Components).

The shift from Vanilla Extract to Tailwind was similar, but more of a developer
experience reason rather than for user experience. The short gist is that using
Vanilla Extract with a Next.js application is incredibly difficult to setup
"correctly". Yes there is a Next.js "plugin", but that doesn't work at all with
React Server Components within Next.js<FootnoteRef id="1" />. For Tailwind
however, all I need to get it working is a `tailwind.config.js` file and Next
does all the hard work for me!

## Refined Thoughts:

After using Tailwind for a few weeks (both on my personal site here, as well as
a few other side projects), I've been really enjoying it!

It's been nice not needing to worry about creating a separate file to maintain
styles (e.g. a `.css.ts` file), or even maintain yet another build process
during development as well!

There are stil some quirks with using Tailwind in my experience that I'd love to
polish up a bit more:

- Figuring out what class I need
- Handling overrides / style composition

#### Figuring out what class I need

This might just be the initial learning curve of using Tailwind, but I feel like
99 times out of 100 I usually use the wrong `align-items: center` classname, and
this happens with a number of other things also (e.g. colors, font-weight, etc).

Some things that have helped with this:

- VS Code Tailwind extension
- Search Tailwind Raycast extension
- ChatGPT ðŸ™ƒ

#### Handling overrides / style composition

This one is a bit gnarly, and is really two issues:

- Working with a component library that has already defined a classname that I
  want to override
- Complex selectors (e.g. the
  ["lobotomized owl selector"](https://alistapart.com/article/axiomatic-css-and-lobotomized-owls/))

I haven't found great solutions for either of these cases, for the second one
I've been reaching for adding a custom class in my `globals.css` file and using
`@apply` from Tailwind.
