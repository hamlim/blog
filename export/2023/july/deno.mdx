This might not be that long of a blog post but I wanted to briefly write about
some exploration that I've been doing with [Deno](https://deno.land/) as of
late.

I was pretty interested in Deno a few years ago, but last time I looked at it
there didn't seem to be too much there besides being a slightly better, but less
compatible version of Node.

Since then however, a ton of things have changed! There's now:

- Compatibility with the `npm` ecosystem via the `npm:` scheme on imports
- A ton of built-in tools like `lint`, `test`, `fmt`, `check`, etc
- The docs are amazing!

A quick aside on the [docs](https://deno.land/manual@v1.35.0/introduction), I've
been digging into some of the Node.js docs recently and jumping back to the Deno
manual has been a breath of fresh air. The Node.js docs are pretty dry and
minimal, whereas the Deno docs are pretty easy to dig into and have a lot of
examples for different features/needs!

I'm starting work on (yet another) side project, and trying to use Deno as much
as possible, it's been really nice being able to ditch the variety of tools I
was using before:

- Babel
- Jest
- Prettier

And drop in Deno for each of them!
