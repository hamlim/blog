Tomorrow (assuming I push this post out tonight) is my 29th birthday. I usually
don't celebrate too big, this year I'm spending two weeks back on the west coast
with family.

I wanted to use this post to help solidify some of my goals over the next year
(as a form of public commitment). I don't normally post year long goals on my
birthday, usually I do that around new years, but I figured why not share it on
my birthday. After all, this next year will lead to me turning 30, which kind of
feels like a big thing!

I don't have many goals yet, but I wanted to highlight a few that came to mind
as we were driving back from Vancouver this afternoon.

## 1. Get healthier

I've fallen back into ordering a lot of delivery ~~fast~~ **junk** food as of
late - I'd like to instead get better at making my own food, and working on a
healthier diet.

On top of that - I really need to stretch out my exercise, at the moment it
consists only of walking but I need to involve more activities to help burn more
calories.

## 2. Improve my wardrobe

My current wardrobe is pretty plain and consists of essentially 4 things:

- Black Eddie Bauer polos
- Shorts from Target
- Pants from Public Rec
- Jeans

At a bare minimum I'd like to stretch my shirt collection a bit, and add in more
variety.

## 3. Optimize finances

I don't necessarily want to start planning for retirement, but I do also want to
better control my finances. To start, I want to get a lot better at
understanding where/how/why I spend my money.

## 4. Get serious about my career

This to me also means getting serious with my side projects, there's a few I'm
working on at the moment that I'd like to see out in the wild - even if I'm the
only one using them!

## Meta:

A few meta notes on goals:

### Check-in Frequently

I really should check-in on the above frequently, and adjust often also to
optimize for change. I'm thinking of checking in weekly to start, but might
adjust back to monthly if that's too aggressive

### Continuously collect data

I'd like to have a solid database of attributes to check in on during the above
check-ins to help inform if I'm actually accomplishing those goals. I really
like projects like: [howisfelix.today](https://howisfelix.today/) and
[Julian's Quantified Self](https://julian.digital/2020/02/23/my-quantified-self-setup/),
and I'd like to build an experience on my personal site that does something
similar if possible!
