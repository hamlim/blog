I was recently reading this Twitter (X?) thread:

<Tweet id="1684522055696351234">
Would anyone like to partner on creating an Electron alternative that builds on top of React Server Components?
It would take the good parts of Electron, Tauri, and React Native. The IPC would be replaced with the server components (React Flight)

specifically this part:

<Tweet id="1684546326871019521">
Try building the React parts on top of Electron first, and then replace Electron once you’ve got the abstractions in the right spot — and you’re sure Electron is the problem

and I got to thinking - what if you could distribute your application as a web
server + a bundled web app?

One major benefit - you don't need to rebuild some web view framework (or
leverage the existing ones that seem to be fairly heavy and hated also), and it
also offers some flexibility to the user for how they want to load the
application.

> But Matt, how would this work??!?!?

You'd need to do the following:

- Build your frontend web application (and server if you have one)
- Package it up into a folder if you want (zip or what not)
- Offer an entrypoint script (really only something to start up the web server -
  maybe some shenanigans for domains [see caveats below])
- Share the "app" as a directory download for the user

Users would then download the folder of assets + web server and start script,
run the start script, and load up your application in their favorite web
browser!

### Caveats:

AKA open questions!

#### What url would you host the app on?

`localhost:3000` or similar is a bit funky - doesn't tell the user what is
running there. If possible, would be nice to register something like
`local.<your-app-name>.app` and tell the OS (via `hosts` file maybe) that the
url should be resolved against `localhost:<your-port>`.

#### What does the start script look like?

Initially I was thinking that it would be a shell script, but I realized that it
could also be a Deno script thats compiled to run as a binary - then it could
package up the web server all in one file too!

## Summary:

That's it - that's the whole idea! Has anyone tried this before? Anyone have
success? I could see a simple native app that handles the host issue for folks,
and then web apps "register" with the native app somehow...
