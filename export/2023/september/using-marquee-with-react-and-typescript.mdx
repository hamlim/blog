I really enjoy using the `<marquee>` HTML element, the fact that it still works
in browsers today even thought its been deprecated (and its sibling `<blink>`
has been removed) makes it all the better.

Its always so cool seeing a webpage show up after some work configuring tools,
or bootstrapping a new app and having the "hello world" message scroll by
automatically because of the marquee element.

Unfortunately, TypeScript and React's types have really leaned into the whole
"deprecated" thing, so you get these red underlines and also sometimes build
fails<FootnoteRef id="1" />.

Fortunately, there's a fix to resolve this pain, unfortunately it's a bit
archaic so I figured I'd put up this blog post to make it easier to find in the
future!

The gist is that you override `JSX.IntrinsicElements` to add the marquee
element.

To fix the issue, create a new `types.d.ts` file in your project, and paste in
the following content:

```ts
import * as React from 'react';

declare global {
  namespace JSX {
    interface IntrinsicElements {
      marquee: React.DetailedHTMLProps<
        React.HTMLAttributes<HTMLElement>,
        HTMLElement
      >;
    }
  }
}
```

Then in your `tsconfig.json` file, add the following:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "types": ["./types.d.ts"]
  }
}
```

Then you may need to restart your editor, but it should resolve the missing
types for the marquee element!

The beauty of this is that you can do the same for any element you may want to
use!
