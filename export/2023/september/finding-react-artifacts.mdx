A while back I wanted to experiment with a more recent version of React in a few
projects. Specifically I wanted to enable some of the feature flags that the
React team uses to gate specific experiemnts. These flags are compile-time
evaluated, meaning I can't simply change them at runtime and have any version of
React installed reflect the changes. Instead, I needed to clone the repo, change
the flags, and then run a build locally.

Now, the React repo may have changed since I last tried this (which was maybe 4
years ago now), but back then you needed to have Java setup locally (or at least
JDK setup) in order to complete the builds. At the time this was a decent hurdle
to overcome, since I was mostly used to more common build toolchains like
Babel/Webpack/etc.

Since then, I've discovered this amazing resource that someone made that hosts
build assets for different PRs, commits, or versions of the packages generated
from the repo. This is the [react-builds](https://react-builds.vercel.app/)
site.

The really neat thing about this site is that you can download any build
artifact for any commit within the repo (as far as I understand it, I'm sure you
probably can't go all the way back to the first commit and download those
builds).

In addition, you can also use this to download and vendor packages that haven't
been published yet (ðŸ‘€ looking at you `react-server-dom-esm` ðŸ‘€).

I was trying to find this resource the other day so I figured I'd blog a bit
about it as a form of long term memory ðŸ˜‚.
