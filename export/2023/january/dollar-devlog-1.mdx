About 7 years ago at the time of writing (January 2023), I started a little side
project while I was in college that I called Dollar. It was meant to be a
financial tracking web application (very original, I know!) that I could
hopefully use to get a better understanding of how much money I was spending and
how I could hopefully become better at budgeting that money as well.

I had kept up development of the application and had something that I was
actually pretty proud of also! Unfortunately over the years I wasn't able to
keep up development and use of it, and it fell into disrepair.

The original version was built using synchronous XHR, jQuery, and some hand
crafted HTML! I had attempted an incremental rewrite into React around 2017 at
some point, but by then the codebase was such a mess that I gave up on the
effort.

I've tried several other rewrites of the same application (with different
designs) since then, but haven't really had the energy to ship any of them and
make them part of my daily workflow.

This afternoon however, I was sitting on the couch and looking for some
motivation to get back into some coding, so I figured I'd dive back in on
rewriting Dollar. I found an iteration from last year or maybe even 2021 that
was looking pretty good so I figure I'll use this as a baseline and work from
there.

A quick recap of the current codebase:

- Using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (using version 10!)
- Using [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) to manage the database (the original
  application used either Fieldbook [now shut down], and then maybe Airtable I
  think)
- Using my component library [DS Pack](https://github.com/ds-pack/components) (a
  really outdated version)

I'm going to start with updating the codebase to some more recent package
versions and seeing how it works out, hopefully it's possible to do so without
breaking everything ðŸ˜‚.

I'll also aim to use this blog post as sort of a running log of my notes and
work at least for today, and who know's maybe tomorrow I'll have a second Devlog
for this work!

An interesting edge case that I haven't accounted for yet within my component
library is a selection UI (e.g. a Dropdown or `<select>` element). I got around
this with the previous iteration of the application by using selectable chips
which I've since stopped supporting within my library. Hmm, will need to think
about the right way to support this feature.

Another interesting hiccup that I'll need to look into is how I want to
integrate Vanilla Extract into the application. The VE Next.js plugin at the
time of writing is still not supported with React Server Components in Next.js
13 sadly. I worked around this with a really rough process of having two build
flows setup for my personal site and another site as well, maybe I opt for that
in this case again as well.

I ended up taking a longer break than I expected and wasn't able to get back to
the project on Sunday, however I had a few ideas over the rest of the weekend
that I would like to explore eventually.
