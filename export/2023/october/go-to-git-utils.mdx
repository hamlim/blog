I've been starting to pick up a few additional utilities that I use alongside
`git` within my development setups, I figured I'd try to collect them here in
this post in case I need to set them up on another computer in the future, or
(maybe more likely) I can share this to friends when they ask me "what was that
command you just ran?!?".

If there's other utilities I should be aware of, reach out to share them!

### gh - [link](https://cli.github.com/)

I probably don't need to say much about this, but I consider this a musthave if
most of your work is on GitHub (either public or enterprise). Where it really
shines for my use case is opening PRs, I use `gh` every single time!

### Git Branchless - [link](https://github.com/arxanas/git-branchless)

This is really many utilities wrapped up in a trenchcoat! It comes with
`git smartlog` (a nicer output on `git log`), and also a `git undo` command
which I strongly believe that `git` should offer by default!

### Git Pile - [link](https://github.com/keith/git-pile)

This has become my go-to tool for supporting a stacked diff like workflow with
git and GitHub. I tried out [`spr`](https://github.com/ejoffe/spr) before but it
enforced that you merge PRs from the command line instead of using the UI (which
also meant it didn't work for me at work where git permissions are intentionally
more restrictive).

`git-pile` "just works"â„¢, using `gh` under the hood (the GitHub CLI) for opening
PRs/interacting with PRs, which means I can use all the same options as I used
to use with the GitHub CLI!
