I recently ready this really good post titled
[Cold-blooded Software](https://dubroy.com/blog/cold-blooded-software/), and it
got me thinking about the two primary reasons that I tend to avoid adopting new
software:

- There's a semver major change coming soon
- The software has become abandoned

The second feels reasonable, why invest in something that is no longer
maintained, no longer gets bug fixes or new features, or nowadays more
importantly keeps up to date with the other libraries and frameworks that it
gets adopted alongside. A recent example of this was that I wanted to look at
adopting [Contentlayer](https://contentlayer.dev/) for my personal blog, however
I checked a few open issues and noticed that the core maintainer of the library
hasnâ€™t been active for a number of months at the time.

My immediate reaction was that I didnâ€™t want to adopt it because it might not
keep up to date with other features or libraries that I used in my personal
blog.

However, this isn't the point of the post, instead the first reason above I
havenâ€™t really seen much content be produced about, but it honestly keeps me
away from libraries and frameworks far more often than the abandonware case, and
it seems like it impacts others just the same:

Spending time and effort to invest into a library or a framework (or a language
for that matter), only to have that be turned on it's head following a semver
major release is disheartening.

You feel like you're making progress, beginning to understand the system, it's
API, the extents of the system, even it's trade offs, and then you need to throw
that all out the window and start over.

Even for libraries that pride themselves on making minimal breaking changes get
burnt by those that don't. Someone gets burnt by the Common JS to ES Module
migration on NPM, and now they feel like the semver major release of Next.js
from 13.x to 14 is going to impossible to work through<FootnoteRef id="1" />.

I'm not sure what the solution is here, maybe myself (and others) can get more
comfortable software changing. Or, just maybe, we can start to harden our
software, make it more slow moving and slow updating, and also maybe vendoring
in more things instead of depending upon as many libraries as we do.

though some of their semver minor releases have been painful in the
