I took about a week and a half off of work starting just before Christmas and
ending right after New Years, I usually use this time to dig into a meaty
project (sometimes related to this blog) and this year was no exception!

I had a few other projects in mind coming into this break but didn't feel too
motivated to work on them. Instead I took the break slow, mainly focusing on my
own working process (revamping my Notion setup) and also getting some
[reading](/bookshelf) in.

However, about halfway into my time off, I found an itch that I just had to
scratch.

My dad and I share new cocktail recipes back and forth fairly
often<FootnoteRef id="1"/>, usually in the form of TikTok clips. We've also been
selecting usually a single (or a couple) specific cocktails that we want to make
for the holidays.

However, we always ask the same questions:

> What ingredients do we need for that one cocktail you wanted to make?

> What was the recipe for that special cocktail again?

This year also, we made one of our favorites from last year
([The Polar Empress](https://tails-theta.vercel.app/recipe/1)) for my
grandparents as well, and the next day my Grandma wanted to get the recipe for
the drink.

Since she had asked about it, and since both of the above questions are common
enough, I felt like it'd be interesting to build a quick and dirty web app to
store cocktail recipes that we can then refer to later<FootnoteRef id="2" />.

And so, I started hacking on [Tails](https://tails-theta.vercel.app/).

ðŸš§ _Be warned, there's still a ton of things I need to get properly
setup with this version of the service, but feel free to mess around and report
any bugs [here](https://github.com/hamlim/tails)_. ðŸš§

## What is Tails?

[Tails](https://tails-theta.vercel.app/) is a very basic
<abbr title="Create Read Update Delete">CRUD</abbr><FootnoteRef id="3" /> web
app for saving and sharing cocktail recipes. That's it at the moment, no social
features, no fancy whiz-bang features, just saving recipes!

It has a very basic version of auth/user accounts at the moment, allows you to
add a recipe (with a title, description, steps, and ingredients), and also
supports sharing those recipes with universal links (viewable to those without
an account on Tails).

## How does it work?

Similar to [microfibre](/blog/2023/november/project-deep-dive-microfibre), Tails is
built with two primary layers:

- API
- Frontend Web Client

The API is built on Cloudflare Workers (using Cloudflare D1 as the storage
solution, [honojs](https://hono.dev/) to handle routing, and
[lucia](https://v3.lucia-auth.com/) for auth), and the frontend web client is
built with Next.js and deployed to Vercel.

The client interactions are all for the most part plain old forms using React
Server Components and Server Actions. The Next.js server then interacts with the
API hosted on Cloudflare.

The code is fully open source and available here:
[hamlim/tails](https://github.com/hamlim/tails), feel free to peruse the source
and open issues for questions/comments/contributions.

If you
[read my microfibre deep dive](/blog/2023/november/project-deep-dive-microfibre),
this tech stack probably sounds pretty familiar! I've been really enjoying
Cloudflare's platform offerings, and I'm particularly interested in exploring
Cloudflare R2 storage soon as well!

## The Future

There's still a ton of things I want to build into the service, the first of
which might be building up user profiles a bit more (so you can see who shared
what cocktails) - however I don't think there's that much future for a social
aspect built into the site!

<Footnote id="1">Ok ok, it's usually me sending him cocktail recipes, but
still</Footnote>

<Footnote id="2">Now I know you're saying "but matt, there's a dozen such
services out there for this use case, why build yet another one?" and to that I
say - because I wanted to!</Footnote>

<Footnote id="3">At the moment, it doesn't even support updating or deleting
recipes! I'll have to add that in the future!</Footnote>
