**Stop Snacking!**

<Spacer />

No I don't mean those Milano cookies you keep taking from the office snack wall
either (although you should probably stop snacking on those as often as well).

<Spacer />

Instead I'm referring to
[low effort and low impact work](https://hunterwalk.com/2016/06/18/the-best-startups-resists-snacks-im-not-talking-about-food/).

Once you get stuck in the snacking zone, it's incredibly hard to break out and
work on the things that actually matter. You might be able to convince yourself
(and maybe your manager) that all that snacking is actually valuable - but it
isn't.

If you're not working on something both high effort **and** high impact, than
you are wasting your time, and your teams time.

I'll re-iterate to help make it stick - **stop snacking**!
