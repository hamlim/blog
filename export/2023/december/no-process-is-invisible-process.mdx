description: "Low/no process workflow wasn't actually no process, it was only an "invisible" process. An implicit contract with everyone on the team to do that async workflow on their own time."

I was talking to someone the other day about our team process, talking and
talking about how our low-process workflow for managing our work and backlog was
really great. We don't waste hours and hours in meetings on planning, preparing,
estimating, etc, and instead everyone on the team creates tickets, plans out
epics, and combs through our backlog also.

This works when there's high trust across the team, the team has jelled, and
they have all internalized this invisible process.

You're probably better off building a bit of "real" process instead, if only to
set the expectation that the work needs to happen.
