A quick
[GitHub search](https://github.com/search?q=unopinionated&type=repositories)
will reveal that there's a lot of libraries and packages out there that brag
about being unopinionated. I think that is a misnomer and instead all these
libraries and packages are just _differently_-opinionated from the
libraries/packages that they are alternatives for.

While it doesn't say so on their site, I feel like the original premise of
[`turborepo`](https://turbo.build/repo) was that it was an unopinionated
monorepo manager. In reality, it just held different opinions about how tasks
should be managed than tools like `nx` or `lerna`.

  If you're looking at adopting some library or package (or even an SaaS application) and one of the main selling points is about it being unopinionated, don't fall for it!

It's fine for a library to express some opinions about how it should be adopted
and how the overall workflow/application in which it is adopted should function.
However, it's false advertising to say that it is unopinionated.
