description: "A deep dive into one of my recent side projects; microfibre - a minimal text posting application"
month: "november"
year: 2023

I recently started building out a new side project that I am calling _microfibre
ðŸ§¶_, it was started partially to scratch an itch to replace Twitter/X with
something a bit more personal. Additionally, I wanted to build a quick and easy
way to share short updates with my grandparents.

<Spacer />

Of note - microfibre is more of a personal product rather than a public social
network. It's a neighborhood cafe rather than an industrial chain restaurant!
I've built it intentionally to only be used by myself, but that doesn't prevent
others from creating similar versions of the same product!

## What is microfibre?

<Spacer />

microfibre is essentially a bulletin board, it allows me to post short-form (but
not limited in length) text updates<FootnoteRef id="1" />, which then get
displayed on my personal site under the [feed view](/feed).

It's currently built using Cloudflare wrangler to power the API, Cloudflare D1
as the datastore, and a Next.js app as the posting client (as well as this
Next.js app powering my blog for rendering the feed). There's nothing magical
about the project - it's a fairly basic
<Abbr title="Acronym standing for Create Read Update Delete, often used to describe basic REST APIs">CRUD</Abbr>
API.

## Where'd it start?

<Spacer />

I started the project the first week of November (2023), and primarily wanted to
use it to learn Go lang. I've been
[messing around with Go](/blog/2023/september/learning-go) for a few months now so I
wanted to use it in a real side project. Additionally I wanted to give deploying
to [Fly](https://fly.io) a try, I've used it here and there before but never
really tried it for a full project.

I built the first version of the application in about 2 total hours, I was
mainly building the application using
[AI via ChatGPT](/blog/2023/november/ai-driven-development).

After messing around with it for a day or two, I started to realize that the
cold starts on Fly were pretty rough. It got to the point that I would need to
re-submit my client form to actually get the post saved in a SQLite DB within
the Fly instance. I'm sure there's something I'm overlooking here - but it just
felt pretty rough so I started to consider some other options.

## Take 2: On the Edge

<Spacer />

I didn't have much time to work on the project until Thanksgiving, but during
the Thanksgiving weekend I found enough time to rewrite the project. I opted to
give Cloudflare Worker a go, and decided to use their D1 SQLite DB offering as
well.

This combination of Worker and D1 is unstoppable - it's a really nice developer
experience, using a local database during development and then using the D1
binding when deployed.

## The Future

<Spacer />

There are a few things I definitely want to look at adding eventually:

- Features:
  - Support for media when posting content
- Technical Changes:
  - Adopting a router for the Worker (I've heard really good things about Hono!)
  - Implementing proper auth (e.g. only letting the client app post content to
    the API)
