I'm really terrible at somehow always thinking of the absolute worst metaphores
for situations and concepts I encounter at work. The latest one that came to
mind is about how teams should operate a bit like caterpillar tracks (you know,
those things that tanks or backhoes drive on!)

For background context, the hot topic that our team has been battling as of late
is context switching, also known as the most challenging problem that most
software engineering teams have to deal with.

As a team, we want to be able to triage inbounds when it makes sense to do so,
but in general we should still strive to move forward on our plans and roadmap.

As individuals on the team, it helps to also have stints of working on the same
problem to enter into the focus zone and build up momentum.

You might be wondering where the connection to caterpillar tracks comes in - and
I don't blame you, this is a really abstract metaphor. The connection my brain
made was that the individual tracks within a set of caterpillar tracks can be
imagined as an individual of the team.

When they hit the ground they stick there while the team (the vehicle) moves
forward, meaning they shouldn't be pulled from their work unless the vehicle
needs to change direction. Often also the team members can stay working on what
they're doing for the most part and not be impacted when the team changes
direction.

Then when they've finished their work, they can pick up the next most important
task - whether thats continuing on with the existing work, or helping to turn
(even slightly) the team as a whole to solving a critical inbound request.

Maybe this metaphor doesn't really make sense, but really at the end of the day
I strongly believe that the team should strive to avoid context switching at all
costs. Continuously switching tasks is a bit like turning 45 degrees every
minute in opposite directions and hoping that you make progress but all you
really end up doing is driving in a long zig-zag.
