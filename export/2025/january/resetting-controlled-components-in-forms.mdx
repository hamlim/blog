If you're starting to leverage some of React's form primitives (e.g. `action` / `formAction` and Server Actions), you might run into the same conundrum I did with controlled components.

By default, React will reset a form after a submission <FootnoteRef id="1" />, however that doesn't really do much to components that manage their own state, the state managed by React will be preserved on the form submit.

This could lead to possibly weird looking form states after submission, or even bugs with previous values being submitted the next time a form is submitted.

However, there's a really neat way to hook into this automatic form reset behavior within your controlled component, and thats by adding a reset event handler!

Here's a small snippet of a controlled component:

```tsx
export function MultiSelect({
  options,
  label,
  name,
  // maybe other props too
}) {
  let [inputValue, setInputValue] = useState("");
  let [selected, setSelected] = useState([]);

  function handleInput(e) {
    setInputValue(e.target.value);
  }
  
  return (
    <>
      <input
        type="hidden"
        value={selected.join(',')}
        name={name}
      />
      <label>
        {label}
        <input
          type="text"
          value={inputValue}
          onChange={handleInput}
        />
        </label>
        <OptionMenu
          filter={inputValue}
          options={options}
          selectedValues={selected}
          onSelect={setSelected}
        />
    </>
  )
}
```

When this is used within a form that is submitted, the `inputValue` and `selected` state values will be preserved, meaning the MultiSelect will probably show you the values instead of an empty state.

The neat way to handle this reset behavior is to add an event listener:

```tsx
// within our `MultiSelect` component
useEffect(() => {
  let controller = new AbortController();

  document.addEventListener(
    'reset',
    () => {
      setInputValue("");
      setSelected([]);
    },
    { signal: controller.signal }
  );
  
  return () => {
    controller.abort();
  }
}, [])
```

And that's it! React, under the hood, effectively calls `formElement.reset()` which will trigger our event listener and clear our managed state!
