The other day I noticed this really succinct and to the point tweet about
snapshot tests from Mark Dalgleish:

    We were snapshotting component markup in isolation, outside of a browser, without

The valuable insight here being the following:

> details.

When I started working with Jest and snapshot testing I thought it was one of
the coolest things ever. It felt like I was adding meaningful code coverage to
my code, when in reality I was only testing the implementation details of it.

Over time I started to realize that the tests I was adding were only adding more
friction to the work I was doing. Since then I have been slowly removing
snapshot tests from my code whenever I make a change that causes the snapshot
tests to fail.
