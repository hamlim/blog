I recently picked up a Pixel Slate computer/tablet (I might write a short review
for it but in the meantime check out
[this thread](https://twitter.com/immatthamlin/status/1133865845854232577?s=20))
and I wanted to see if I could configure my personal site, this site, so I could
write a blog post, publish and deploy it all from my new computer. I also
haven't setup the linux partition on the device yet either so I wanted to be
able to do all of this from within Chrome.

Before I dive into how I setup this flow, I wanted to provide some insight into
this site. Its a Gatsby site, where most of my posts are authored using MDX,
feel free to check out the source code for the site here:
[https://github.com/hamlim/blog-2k19](https://github.com/hamlim/blog-2k19). I am
also using Zeit's `now` product to deploy the site and alias it to the current
url. In order to automate deployments I would need to have Gatsby build the
site, and then deploy using now.

A while back I signed up for the GItHub Actions beta, and somehow got access to
it too! I have been fumbling around with it for the past few weeks, not really
putting enough time into it to learn how to fully configure a workflow. So this
new challenge provided the necessity to actually learn how to configure these
workflows and actions.

At a high level, the mixed manual and automated process looks like this:

- Author blog posts in Notion in their web app
- Carry the blog post over to Github, where I use their online IDE to add a new
  entry
- Open a PR with the new blog post, review it for any grammar issues, typos, etc
- Merge the PR to master
- Kickoff a push GitHub workflow that does the following
  - Filter out pushes to other branches, so it only runs on master
  - Install dependencies using Yarn
  - Run `yarn build`
  - Deploy using `now`
  - Alias the site using a local now.json file in the repo to my
    [matthamlin.me](https://matthamlin.me) domain
- See the updated content on the public site!

I am using the following actions created by several others available on the
Actions marketplace:

- GitHub Action for Yarn:
  [https://github.com/nuxt/actions-yarn](https://github.com/nuxt/actions-yarn)
- GitHub Action for Now:
  [https://github.com/actions/zeit-now](https://github.com/actions/zeit-now)
