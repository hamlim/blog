I recently picked up a Pixel Slate tablet/computer and I have really enjoyed
using it for a lot of random tasks that I do besides writing code (although I
can even write some code on it too). One of the things that it has been forcing
me to think about has been how I can get my blog setup to let me publish content
without needing to run a lot of developing tooling like Node, Gatsby, and many
other processes.

In the past I have put too much effort into making longer and longer blog posts,
putting a lot of emphasis around how I structure my thoughts and often getting
to the point where it feels like I have about 20% of the blog post content, and
then feel like I have 80% more work to do before publishing.

I think this new form of computing will let me focus on publishing faster, along
with publishing faster I also want to get over the writers block of feeling like
I need to fill up a longer blog post before hitting publish.

I will be looking at automating my blog build process so I can simply commit
some markdown files through GitHub's web interface and have a push to master
automatically build and deploy the site.
