As I have been working on my personal blog, I wanted to include the ability to
edit code on site, and also preview it live. I started using
[react-live](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/react-live) which I have had
prior experience using and setting up, however I wanted to customize the theme
of the editor a bit and try to work on a new and challenging task over the
weekend.

So I decided to build `@matthamlin/react-preview-editor`
([see the project here](https://github.com/hamlim/react-preview-editor)).

## Starting Off with Executing Code

I started off by looking at the source of react-live to figure out how they are
able to actually call the code that you edit inline. It turns out, that they use
the `new Function` contructor to pass the code as a string along with an
assortment of the keys of the things within scope for the code, and then call
the function.

```js
function evaluateCode(code, scope) {
  // scope looks like this: { variableName: 'value' }
  // construct a new function with the code
  const func = new Function(...Object.keys(scope), code);
  // Call the function
  func(...Object.values(scope));
}
```

This allows us to evaluate code that the user types within the editor on the
site, and probably goes without saying but could be a really bad‚Ñ¢Ô∏è thing to do
with live user input.

So now that we know how to actually execute the users code, how do we build the
editor part?

## The Code Editor

Well that part is actually pretty simple, because other awesome developers out
there, have already shared open source projects for editing code within the
browser. Since I wanted to keep the project fairly small, I went with
[react-simple-code-editor](http://satya164.xyz/react-simple-code-editor/).

This editor allows me to control the highlighting of the code complete, and also
is really easy to just start using:

```jsx
<Editor
  // Give it a value
  value={code}
  // Handle changes to the code
  onValueChange={(code) => updateCode(code)}
  // Provider it a function that returns a string or a React Node
  // to highlight the code
  highlight={highlighter}
/>;
```

Great, so we have a way to execute the code, and a way to edit the code, what
about the syntax highlighting though?

## Highlighting the Code

Well we are just as lucky as we were before, thanks to the
[prism-react-renderer](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/prism-react-renderer)
library, we are able to use a React wrapping API around the `prismjs` library.

This ends up looking like:

```jsx
// This is the same function we pass to the Editor component above
function highlighter(code) {
  return (
    <Highlight {...defaultProps} code={code} language='jsx'>
      {({ className, style, tokens, getLineProps, getTokenProps }) => (
        <pre className={className} style={style}>
          {tokens.map((line, i) => (
            <div {...getLineProps({ line, key: i })}>
              {line.map((token, key) => (
                <span {...getTokenProps({ token, key })} />
              ))}
            </div>
          ))}
        </pre>
      )}
    </Highlight>
  );
}
```

## Wrapping Up

So wrapping it all up, we end up with an API that looks like this:

{/*
<!-- prettier-ignore -->
// ==live== template="react" customSetup={"dependencies":{"@matthamlin/react-preview-editor":"latest","@babel/standalone":"latest"}}
*/}
```jsx
import { transform } from '@babel/standalone';
import { Editor, Preview, Provider } from '@matthamlin/react-preview-editor';

function transformCode(code) {
  return transform(code, {
    presets: [['stage-0', { decoratorsLegacy: true }], 'react'],
  }).code;
}

const code = `
function App() {
  return (
    <p>Code Here!</p>
  )
};
render(<App />);
`;

export default function App() {
  return (
    <Provider code={code} transformCode={transformCode}>
      <Preview />
      <Editor />
    </Provider>
  );
}
```
