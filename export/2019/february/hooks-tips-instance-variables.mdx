Frequently, `class` based components can have a decent number of instance
variables on them that are unrelated to state or props. These might be used to
store refs for elements, or other data that you may need within the component.

These values are useful to store on the instance because updating them does not
trigger a re-render of the component. Here is an example of a class based
component that uses a few instance methods (_Note_: This is using a non-standard
JavaScript syntax to assign the instance variables.):

```jsx
class InstanceComponent extends React.Component {
  someTimer = null;
  inputRef = null;
  data = {
    someData: {
      foo: 'bar',
    },
  };

  // ...
}
```

When migrating to Hooks, React offers the `useRef` hook, which is a convenient
way to store some mutable data through the lifecycle of a component.

Lets take a look at what this looks like with hooks:

```jsx
function HookComponent() {
  const someTimer = React.useRef(null);
  const data = React.useRef({
    someData: {
      foo: 'bar',
    },
  });

  // Note, the inputRef is just a regular old element ref
  // in this case, so we can use `createRef` which will assign
  // the instance for us. We could also still use `useRef` here and it
  // will continue to work as expected!
  const inputRef = React.createRef();
}
```

Cool, but when I attempt to access `data.someData.foo` I get an error, what
gives?

```jsx
function HookComponent() {
  const data = React.useRef({
    someData: {
      foo: 'bar',
    },
  });

  // ⚠️ This will throw an error:
  // Unable to access foo of undefined
  console.log(data.someData.foo);
}
```

Well, `useRef` returns you a wrapper around your current value:

```jsx
console.log(data);
// { current: { someData: { foo: 'bar' } } }
```

We can conceptualize this like the return value of calling `React.createRef()`,
where our variable is accessible on the `current` property.

### Avoid Large Ref Values

This is more of a preference than an actual bug/issue within the code, however
it may be tempting to convert your instance variables all down to a single
`useRef` call:

```jsx
function UglyHooksComponent() {
  const instance = React.useRef({
    someTimer: null,
    inputRef: React.createRef(),
    data: {
      someData: {
        foo: 'bar',
      },
    },
  });
}
```

While this may look beneficial, and may be easier to access the properties, it
makes it potentially more difficult to split up the logic into separate hooks.

In general, **always prefer to keep `useRef` (and `useState`) calls limited in
scope**, and bias towards hook composition instead.[^1]

From our first example above, we may want to split the timer instance variable
into a custom `useTimer` hook that our component can leverage, and the
`inputRef` can be accomplished using just a top level `createRef`.

For additional insight into how to `useRef`, refer to the
[ReactJS Docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-faq.html#is-there-something-like-instance-variables)

I should write yet another blog post about why I have this preference, but for
now feel free to accept it as a pattern.
