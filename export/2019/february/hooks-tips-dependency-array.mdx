Some of the built-in hooks from the React package expose a second argument which
acts as an indicator or signal to React to determine if the function provided as
the first argument to the hook should be invoked again.

In this post I will only reference `useEffect`, however there are several hooks
which follow this pattern:

- `useMemo`
- `useCallback`

In general, the notes below will apply to these other hooks as well.

I have also ordered the examples below based off of how frequently they will
most likely be used, the first being the most frequent example and the last
being the least frequently used.

### Passing Dependencies:

```jsx
function App() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  useEffect(() => {
    // Gets called on initial render, and every time `count` changes
  }, [count]);
  return null;
}
```

This example may be the most frequent example of using the `useEffect` hook,
here we indicate to React that the function we provided to `useEffect` depends
on the `count` variable from the components own scope. React will then track the
`count` variable, and call the effect function when the `count` value changes.

### An Empty Dependency Array:

```jsx
function App() {
  useEffect(() => {
    // Only gets called when the component "mounts"
  }, []);
  return null;
}
```

This example will call the function provided to `useEffect` only on the
components first render. This can be useful for cases like tracking when a
component renders, or fetching some initial data that doesn't depend on any
other values.

### No Dependency Array:

```jsx
function App() {
  useEffect(() => {
    // Gets called on every re-render of the App component
  });
  return null;
}
```

This will cause the function provided to `useEffect` to be called on every
render of the App component.

**This should be used rarely within regular code**, frequently the function
provided in this case is actually dependent on some value from the parent scope
of the component and should be included in the array of dependencies like shown
below.
