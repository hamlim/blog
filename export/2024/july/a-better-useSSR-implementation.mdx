For teams working within a server side rendered react app (like when using Next.js or Remix), I often see a `useSSR` (or `useClient`) hook within the codebase.

These hooks usually return a boolean indicating if we're on the client or being server rendered - this can be useful to introduce some functionality when we are on the client and now have access to the `window` or `navigator` globals for example, or can be a useful way to render different UI on the server or the client!

Most of these implementations look something like this:

```tsx
import {useState, useEffect} from 'react';

export function useSSR() {
  let [mounted, setMounted] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    setMounted(true)
  }, [])

  return mounted;
}
```

This implementation isn't all that bad - it's relatively easy to understand what's happening!

However, this implementation causes a double render on the client - which can sometimes be less than ideal. The first render is the hydration pass on the server rendered HTML, the second render is after the `setState` is applied within the `useEffect`.

There's now a better way to implement this within React: `useSyncExternalStore`!

The name is pretty confusing - it was original built to help external stores (e.g. Redux, Jotai, etc) integrate better with React's scheduler. However it is pretty flexible to be used for a few other use cases as well!

Here's the new implementation using `useSyncExternalStore`:

```tsx
import {useSyncExternalStore} from 'react';

let emptySubscribe = () => () => {};

export function useSSR() {
  return useSyncExternalStore(
    emptySubscribe,
    // client value:
    () => true,
    // server value:
    () => false,
  );
}
```

This will return the same values as our old implementation - but skips the need for a re-render after an effect runs. React does the heavy lifting for that now with this new hook!

I first saw this referenced from [this tweet](https://x.com/TkDodo/status/1741068994981826947):

Basically abusing `useSyncExternalStore` to safely read server snapshots on the server and on the first client render, and then falling back to the client snapshot.<br /><br />The good thing is that on client sideâ€¦ <a href="https://t.co/9qDJjdbYqj">pic.twitter.com/9qDJjdbYqj</a></p>&mdash; Dominik ðŸ”® (@TkDodo) <a href="https://twitter.com/TkDodo/status/1741068994981826947?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 30, 2023</a>
