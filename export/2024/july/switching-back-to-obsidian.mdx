My [previous post on switching to Notion](/blog/2022/may/switching-back-to-notion) was pretty straight forward at the time, the syncing limitations that I ran into back then are still present but I've mostly changed my workflow around enough that they're no longer major issues.

Honestly - the main motivation for me wanting to go back to [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) is to own and control my own notes more than I could with Notion (effectively the [file over app](https://stephanango.com/file-over-app) concept).

I've also continued to realize that Notion is really terrible with offline use - which I'm coming around to valuing more and more.

In fact, the offline support (or really lack thereof) was starting to motivate me to consider building an application that would support offline features better - only to realize that Obsidian has ~90% of the features that I want out of my note taking software needs.

There's still some notable gaps with Obsidian (and some plugins workaround this - but maybe not to the fidelity that I'd like), and I may opt to hack on some plugin ideas in my (limited) free time. However I think I can slightly change my workflow enough to get by just fine with some of the defaults.

I've now been using Obsidian for over a month solid, recreating my daily notes flow from Notion using the [Daily Notes plugin](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Daily+notes) + some templates, and also a pretty effective task management workflow (still kind of manually managed, but the [tasks plugin](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Introduction) is really useful, maybe I'll write up how I approach it in the near future).

__Update!__ I wrote a bit about how I manage my tasks within obsidian [here](/blog/2024/july/simple-obsidian-task-management)
