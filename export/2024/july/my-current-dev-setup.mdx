I think I've written a bit about the tools that I use day-to-day, or some of the cool applications I've discovered to help do web development, but I haven't done so in quite some time so I figured I'd write a more up to date post!

Often I get inspired by seeing other's setups to try some new tools, I hope this post serves more as a way to expose anyone reading to something new that they may want to try out. At the end of the day, I think it's worth investing time to create your own workflows{/* ([[build your own tools]])*/}!

### Editor:

Currently I'm using [VSCode Insiders](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/) - I had tried out [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/), but ran out of their free tier offerings and honestly it wasn't too much better than GitHub Copilot (more on that below). If you're willing to pay for it - Cursor is pretty good, but if you already pay for GitHub Copilot then it may not be worth also paying for Cursor.

I currently use the [Vitesse](https://vscodethemes.com/e/antfu.theme-vitesse/vitesse-dark-soft?language=javascript) theme, but previously I was using the [GitHub Light theme](https://vscodethemes.com/e/github.github-vscode-theme/github-light-default?language=javascript).

I also use a number of extensions, including but not limited to:

- [GitHub Copilot](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot)
- [Playwright Test](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-playwright.playwright)
- [Tailwind CSS IntelliSense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss)

### Terminal:

I'm currently using [warp](https://warp.dev) as my go-to terminal, the tabs and panels, and some of the better autosuggest / history features are really good, plus it supports a wide range of custom themes as well so I'm also using the Vitesse theme for warp.

I don't really use the AI features bundled in with the terminal, but sometimes they can be useful.

I've tried out [wave](https://waveterm.dev/) and also using the built in terminal in VSCode but warp just felt like the best tool for my needs.

### Misc:

I've been using [GitButler](https://gitbutler.com/) lately and kind of enjoying it - it definitely still has some quirks but honestly feels like the best "open" way to manage a stacked diff like workflow. I had tried [Graphite](https://graphite.dev/) before but it was pretty limiting if you didn't go all in on it's toolchain and now is only targeting teams instead of individual devs I think.

I still feel like there's got to be a better stacked diff workflow (CLI and an optional GUI) to be built - but for now GitButler is my go to!

I always highly recommend using [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/), I pay for the pro plan to get a few added features, but honestly this is one of the best applications I use day to day, it makes switching between windows/applications a lot easier, and also the clipboard history is so handy!

A few other smaller ones that I use/recommend:

- [Arc](https://arc.net) - It's hard for me to use any other browser these days!
- [Dropbox Capture](https://capture.dropbox.com) - this is the best screenshot and screen recording tool I've found on mac, quick and easy keyboard shortcuts and it uploads them all to my dropbox for easy sharing too!
- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) - I [recently switched back from Notion](/blog/2024/july/switching-back-to-obsidian) and have been really enjoying using Obsidian for all my note taking needs!
- [ChatGPT Mac App](https://openai.com/chatgpt/mac/) - I've bound `ctrl+space` as a shortcut to trigger ChatGPT and it's been incredibly useful!
