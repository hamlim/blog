It's kind of wild that it's already been a year since I published [my last birthday post](/blog/2023/july/29), time has gone by quite quickly over the last year.

In the past year I've:

- [Changed jobs](/blog/2024/may/leaving-wayfair)
- [Published a ton of blog posts](/blog)
- [Created](https://x.com/immatthamlin/status/1790111809791308173) [quite](https://x.com/immatthamlin/status/1793056949434486946) [a few](https://x.com/immatthamlin/status/1790750021681344951) [open source](https://x.com/immatthamlin/status/1777091844779683931) [projects](/blog/2024/january/building-better-beacon)

## Recap:

I also want to revisit the goals that I set for myself in my previous birthday post:

- Get healthier
- Improve my wardrobe
- Optimize finances
- Get serious about my career

Overall - I feel like I've made decent progress across all of them!

### Get Healthier ðŸ«¤

I crunched the numbers on both my step count and my weight (which actually wasn't all that bad to do, but I had to merge data I captured in Notion with data I've been capturing in Obsidian [since migrating](/blog/2024/july/switching-back-to-obsidian)), my weight honestly looks pretty bad over the past year, but within the past few months it's starting to move in the right direction.

My steps also seem alright - but honestly it's pretty biased around when I go on vacation (end of May in Mexico, early July 2024 in Connecticut and California) so I need to keep up my walking habit while away from home.

### Improve my wardrobe âœ…

There's not much data to pull here - but now I'm cycling in some new black t-shirts, some new long and short sleeve button ups, and also some new shorts and pants.

### Optimize finances âœ…

Again hard to share some hard numbers here (mostly because I'm not sure I want to share my finances with everyone ðŸ˜‚), however I've started using [Copilot](https://copilot.money/) (not [that copilot](https://copilot.github.com/)) and it's been really nice to see general trends, get automatic monthly recaps on my expenses and income. I highly recommend it!

### Get serious about my career âœ…

As I noted above - since last year [I left Wayfair](https://matthamlin.me/blog/2024/may/leaving-wayfair) and [joined Fireworks](https://fireworks.ai). It's been quite the shift and I hope to spend some time writing up more of my thoughts there so stay tuned.

## Goals:

Looking forward, I want to set the following goals for the next year:

**Get serious about my health**

This is partially a carry over from this last year, but I didn't really devote much concentrated effort on this. I've been thinking about doing more focused workouts instead of my usual walks (number of steps isn't everything)!

**Build more**

I've been kicking the can down the road on a number of side projects - some of which I really want to get off the ground. I want to launch at least 2 projects that are more than just open source libraries this next year.
