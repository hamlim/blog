## Introducing hohoro

`hohoro` is an incremental build tool for JS/TS libraries, leveraging SWC and TSC under the hood!

Check out the project here: [https://hohoro.vercel.app/](https://hohoro.vercel.app/).

Most build tools for libraries impose additional restrictions on the configuration that is exposed to you - often wrapping some core tools that you end up needing to use for other things (like configuring tests for example).

hohoro approaches things a bit differently...

---

It doesn't directly wrap those core tools, and instead lets you configure them as needed.

On top of that, it adds a light weight incremental build cache - like

---

We started to adopt this pattern at Wayfair to help with incremental compile times for larger libraries and saw big wins for local development!
