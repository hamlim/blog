For the past two years I've been tracking yearly goals for myself, however I haven't been starting them on January 1st like most others often do. Instead I've used my birthday (July 20th) as my "point of reference" for these yearly goals. (see [29](/blog/2023/july/29) and [30](/blog/2024/july/30) for examples).

January 1st provides a nice starting point as it's the start of a new calendar year, but for goal setting you don't need to wait for a specific date to start tracking progress and improving.

Don't wait to start making progress, set some goals, check back on them frequently, and improve!
