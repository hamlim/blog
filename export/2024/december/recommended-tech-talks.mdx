There's a number of tech talks that I routinely revisit every once and while and also share frequently with others because I think they're so foundational to my career as a web developer. 

I figured I'd write a blog post sharing those talks!

### React Conf 2015 - Hype

Arguably probably my favorite tech talk that I've every watched. It's probably sad to say that I return to watch this every once in a while to have my mind blown!

The magic move demo is still wild to think about!

### Scaling R&D to thousands of people without dedicated QA

This talk really influenced how I thought about building platforms while I worked at Wayfair, and then in every role since then!

### (Game) Development Caution

While this isn't a formal talk, it's still a really amazing video that I recommend all developers to watch and listen to!

### Bret Victor - Inventing on Principle

I don't think I need to provide too much of a prelude for this talk - it's simply wonderful and gives me a similar vibe as the Hype talk above!
