> Originally written while I was at Wayfair, this was a team memes doc to help explain common memes among our Frontend Platform team at the time.

Theres usually a number of recurring memes that our team seems to hold on to and we sometimes refer
to during various meetings / discussions, this doc aims to capture some of those and describe what
they mean so everyone knows what we mean!

First off, `meme` in this context is referring to:

> ... an idea, behavior, style, or usage that spreads from person to person within a culture ...

## "Holding it wrong"

This is a reference to the early iPhone issues where users were tightly gripping their phones causing the cell antenna to short and resulting in really poor cell reception. [See this for context](https://www.wired.com/2010/06/iphone-4-holding-it-wrong/).

We generally use this to mean that we're not using a tool/framework/pattern/etc the way that it was intended to be used. e.g. Using `AsyncLocalStorage` to pass values into server components in Next, and also pass values "back up" to express.

## F.A.A.F.O. (Fuck Around and Find Out)

We use this to mean "we don't know, so experiment and learn".

e.g.

"Just try removing CPU limits for our HPA settings, FAAFO!"

## Developer Caution

We use this as a general "excuse" of sorts for why it might take a while for changes to happen.

e.g.

"They had too much developer caution"

This originates from this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMVQ30c7TcA

## Speculative Generality

As I understand it, this originated from a former Wayfairian Evan Davis, who used it to call out times in development where you are jumping to making a solution overly generalizable.

e.g.

"We need to add in a queue system with a publisher and a subscriber in case we start supporting more clients!"

## Cooking ("Let them cook" / "overcooked" / "undercooked")

This is effectively a direct reference to [current slang](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/let-him-cook-let-that-boy-cook).

- "Let them cook" - meaning let them work
  - Example: "Let copilot cook"
- "Overcooked" - meaning someone over-engineered something
  - Example: "They definitely overcooked with this implementation!"
- "Undercooked" - meaning it's been underbaked / not fully implemented
  - Example: "We undercooked our solution, we need to make it better"
