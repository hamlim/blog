The other day I was reminded of two neat tricks related to customizing your favicon to bring some delight to your website visitors and also to improve your development flow - all thanks to <TwitterMention>scottykaye</TwitterMention>!

## Customizing Favicons for Light and Dark Mode

The first recipe is a neat way to change the favicon of your site based on the preferred color scheme of the visitor. You can use the `<link />` tag's `media` attribute
to have the browser "choose" the preferred icon based on light or dark mode.

If you're writing plain old html (or using some framework that gives you control over the html), you can use the below snippet to accomplish this:

```html
<head>
  <link rel="icon" href="./light-mode-favicon.ico" media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" />
  <link rel="icon" href="./dark-mode-favicon.ico" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" />
</head>
```

If you're using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and it's `metadata` or `generateMetadata` exports, you can do the following:

```ts
export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: "Custom light/dark mode favicons",
  description: "Generated by create next app",
  icons: [
    {
      rel: "icon",
      url: "./sun-favicon.ico",
      media: "(prefers-color-scheme: light)",
    },
    {
      rel: "icon",
      url: "./moon-favicon.ico",
      media: "(prefers-color-scheme: dark)",
    },
  ],
};
```

## Customizing Favicons for Development and Production

This is a pretty neat trick that makes it just a bit easier to determine if you're looking at the development version of your site or the production one.

We've all been there, we're about 45 minutes into trying to debug an issue, you keep making more basic and basic changes to the code, refreshing the page
in the browser and still can't see your changes. Only to then realize that you've been madly refreshing the production site expecting to find your
local changes.

With a custom icon for development, you'll no longer get stuck in that situation again!

If you're using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and it's `metadata` or `generateMetadata` exports, you can do the following:

```ts
export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: "Custom favicon per environment",
  description: "Generated by create next app",
  icons: [
    {
      rel: "icon",
      url: process.env.NODE_ENV === "production"
        ? "./env-favicon.ico"
        : "./env-favicon-dev.ico",
    },
  ],
};
```
