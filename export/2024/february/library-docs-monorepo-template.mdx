I was talking with <TwitterMention>scottykaye</TwitterMention> the other day
since he was starting to scaffold out a small frontend app to demo and document
one of his open source libraries, and brought up using a monorepo to support
both the library (which can be published to NPM) and a documentation site (and
more).

He wanted to learn a bit more about the setup and recommended that I write a
brief blog post about the structure that I usually reach for in these cases,
which I've iterated on quite a bit since some of my very early open source
endeavors.

If you just want to get started with the template and don't care too much about
how to set it up yourself, you can start from this
[template monorepo](https://github.com/hamlim/template-monorepo).

## Recommended Tooling:

These days I mostly use [Bun](https://bun.sh) as my package manager for my
projects, so I'll be using it in this blog post, but the same setup should work
perfectly fine with `yarn` and `pnpm` (and probably `npm` as well - but I
haven't used it personally).

## Setup:

Setup a repo with a root `package.json` that includes a `workspaces` key that
includes two entries: `["docs", "packages/*"]`.

```json
{
  "private": true,
  "workspaces": [
    "docs",
    "packages/*"
  ]
}
```

Then create the `docs` and `packages` directories.

```sh
mkdir docs packages
```

Within the `docs` dir, you can create a documentation site using your favorite
tools (personally I use Next at the moment):

```sh
cd docs
bunx create-next-app .
```

and within the `packages` dir, you can create another directory named the same
as your package:

```sh
cd packages
mkdir my-package
```

Inside your package directory, you'll want to setup a new package like you
normally might (either using something like `bun init` or manually creating your
`package.json` and other config).

To use your package within your docs site, you can add it to the dependencies
within your `docs/package.json` file:

```json
{
  "name": "docs",
  "dependencies": {
    "my-package": "workspace:*"
  }
}
```

<Callout>

Tip: The `workspace:*"` specifier is a common pattern supported by modern
package managers that let's you declare a local workspace dependency, at any
version!

</Callout>

## Additional Ideas

The great part about this setup - is that you can continue to add on workspaces
from the repo as you need them.

- Do you need a workspace to add end-to-end tests for your package, create an
  `e2e` workspace by adding it to the `workspaces` array in the root
  `package.json` and create a directory for it!
- Do you want a kitchen-sink like demo application that isn't necessarily the
  same as your docs site? Create a `kitchen-sink` directory and workspace!
- Have some additional tools / packages you'd like to split off, you can easily
  spin up additional workspaces within your `packages/` directory!

The capabilities are endless!

## Summary

While this isn't really that new of a concept - folks have been using monorepos
for a while within the frontend development space, I feel like it's often
overlooked for single-package repositories when it still has some nice benefits.
It's made me wonder if we even need single-workspace repos at all!
