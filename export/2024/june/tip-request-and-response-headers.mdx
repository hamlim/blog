The other day I was working on some unit tests for a minimal Cloudflare Worker that would redirect the incoming request while forwarding along some of the original request headers. I setup a test to call the worker's `fetch` handler with a `new Request` that had some headers provided:

```ts
let request = new Request('https://something.com', {
  headers: {
    'x-foo': 'bar',
    'x-baz': 'qux'
  }
});
```

I then called the worker's `fetch` handler with this request:

```ts
let response = await worker.fetch(request);
```

However, the headers weren't propagating into the request that my worker's `fetch` handler was seeing - since I was calling the method directly I figured it had to be something with the runtime that I was writing the tests within (in this case, Bun).

I did some sleuthing online and found [this issue](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/issues/6288). The creator of the issue noted something about this being baked into the spec for `new Request` and `new Response` objects, and that they don't "hydrate" from a `HeadersInit` object.

To instead make it work, I had to write my test like this:

```ts
let request = new Request('https://something.com');
request.headers.set('x-foo', 'bar');
request.headers.set('x-baz', 'qux');

let response = await worker.fetch(request);
```
