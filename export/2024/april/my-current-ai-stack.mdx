I've been using a variety of AI tools for a bit now, and figured that I'd at least start to document what I'm using and why. This is a work in progress, and I'll update it as I change my stack!

If I haven't updated this recently, feel free to pester me about it on Twitter: <TwitterMention>immatthamlin</TwitterMention>!

## My Current Stack

- **[ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/)**: This is usually my go-to for in-depth conversations and iterative thinking. I've been paying for the pro plan for a couple of months now.
- **[GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot/)**: I've really enjoyed using GitHub Copilot for my development needs. It's not always the best but has improved a lot of the monotonous parts of my workflow.
- **[Perplexity.ai](https://www.perplexity.ai/)**: Thanks to Arc, this has now been my go-to search engine for anything. I still de-opt back to Google for some things, but this has been a great tool for me.
- **[Anthropic Claude](https://claude.ai/)**: This is a recent addition to my stack, I've used it intermittently in place of ChatGPT for some things. It's been a great tool for me so far.
- **[Raycast AI](https://www.raycast.com/)**: I've been using Raycast for a while now, and the AI features have been a great addition to my workflow.
- **[Notion AI](https://www.notion.so/help/guides/using-notion-ai)**: I haven't honestly been using Notion's AI offering too much, but I've been attempting to use Notion more and more. I feel like there's more opportunity here.
