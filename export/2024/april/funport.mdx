If you've ever wanted to leverage `import()` from the browser (or node process) within an application that uses webpack - you have probably realized that webpack "hijacks" the `import()` function and replaces it with its own implementation. This is great for static imports, but what if you want to dynamically import a module that webpack doesn't know about at build time?

I was running into this limitation the other day, and couldn't really find any good resources out there that helped me to workaround the limitation.

To note - the limitation is there because webpack defaults to attempting to statically analyze your code and build a dependency graph. This is great for performance and tree shaking, but not so great when you want to dynamically import a module in your application at runtime!

The solution that I found was to use `new Function` (an often overlooked but incredible utility) to build our own `import()` method that webpack doesn't know about.

```tsx
// Where the fun begins
let funport = new Function('url', 'return import(url)');
```

Now you can use `funport` to dynamically import modules in your application!

Here's a quick example:

```tsx
let {createElement} = await funport('https://esm.sh/react');

function App() {
  return createElement('h1', null, 'Hello, World!');
};
```
