The web is one of the best things in the world. It has never been replicated and
something may never reach the same kind of exposure that it has. The only
problem with the web is that there is too much content to follow along with. I
sometimes discover a really cool website, only to forget about it sometime
later.

If you think about it the web is ephemeral, not just in the sense that a website
can be there one month and gone the next but that you can discover a website one
day and then the next day completely forget about it.

I decided I wanted to keep a directory of (some useful) links that I have
stumbled upon. I will be adding more links to this list for as long as I
remember to and also I plan on sorting this in the future so it is easy to
navigate through.
