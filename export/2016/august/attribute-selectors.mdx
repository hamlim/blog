I have recently been reading a lot of interesting articles and looking at a few
interesting Codepen's that deal with attribute selectors. The two links that
stand out the most are
[this article](https://css-tricks.com/weird-design-languages-with-attributes/)
about making a design language with attribute selectors and
[this](http://codepen.io/alexzaworski/pen/xOBmXP) Codepen about making a color
mixer from attribute selectors.

After I saw these two ideas expressed I began to think about specificity.
Regularly when dealing with css developers need to keep in mind the number of
selectors they use to style specific parts of a website. It really only gets
complicated when managing a large codebase with several developers all authoring
new code and also updating old code. _So if you are looking for a solution for a
large company (more than 5 developers) this is probably not the way to go._

The large reason why I began to see Attribute Selectors as being awesome is
because I wouldn't need to arbitrarily increase my specificity just to style
things like id specific elements. This becomes immediately valuable when dealing
with any links that link to a specific element on the current document.

```css
#id {
  color: red;
}
[id='id'] {
  color: red;
}
```

These two snippets of css are exactly the same, except for their specificity,
because attribute selectors are equivalent to class selectors and id selectors
are equivalent to 0,1,0,0. In case you can't tell yet, this s huge! Now the only
time that developers have to worry about specificity is when nesting rules in
preprocessors like SASS or LESS.

But wait, theres more! You actually don't have to worry about nesting selectors
either! Attribute selectors are so smart that you can build out "nested"-like
selectors simply with their own operators. Attribute selectors have this sweet
functionality with matching attributes. These are fully explained in this great
article by CSS-Tricks which can be found
[here](https://css-tricks.com/attribute-selectors/). The gist is that you can
select based on if the attribute is exactly equal to something, begins with a
certain value, ends with a certain value, is in a space separated list, and is
in a dash separated list.

##### Exactly Equal to:

`[attribute='something']`

##### Begins with a value:

`[attribute^='something']`

##### Ends with a value:

`[attribute$='something']`

##### Space separated list:

`[attribute~='something']`

##### Dash separated list:

`[attribute|='something']`

##### Substring match:

`[attribute*='something']`

##### Case Insensitivity [^1]:

`[attribute='something' i]`

With all these we can make basically any nested structure you might make in SASS
or in LESS.

I haven't yet updated my css for this site to use attribute selectors but it is
on my list. The main reason I haven't done it yet is because its really
semantic. So far it includes a lot of typing whereas a simple class syntax and
nesting classes with preprocessors is really easy to type and is still really
powerful. I will be replacing all id selectors with attribute selectors however
because it will make my code a lot easier to manage in the long run.

### Footnotes:

[^1]: Note: Operator here can be any of the predefined operations in the above
examples, such as `=`, `~=`, `|=`, `^=`, `$=`, and `*=`. Also the `i` can be
lowercase or uppercase.
