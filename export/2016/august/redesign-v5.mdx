Technically the name of this document is <var>designV5.html</var> however I
really don't know what version this is of my personal webpage. I know I have
written about redesigning this website about 2 or three times now
(<a href="/post/Redesign" >once here</a> and again
<a href="/post/Weekend-Projects">here</a>).

The point of the matter is that I have redesigned my website several times over
and each time I generally design it using the new things I have learned about
design and web development. This time I wanted to focus on revitalizing my blog
and making my website look a bit more professional.

I have officially dropped any need for external resources (css, images, other
assets are all locally hosted), and as with the past redesign I have completely
cut out any Javascript resources. Of course all this leads to faster lead times
which is a great benefit.

One of the things that I also realized along the redesign process was that I
will no longer be supporting any browser older than Edge, that means that I am
doing no optimization with any of the css to let it work with older browsers.
The main reason I am doing this is because I believe writing code to work with
older browsers is fairly useless at this point <em>(Sorry <small>not
sorry</small> IE8 users)</em>.
