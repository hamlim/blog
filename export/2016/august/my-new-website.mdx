Over the past 2 or three weeks I have been both busy at work and also busy
outside of work. Most of my work that I have been doing outside of work has been
devoted to this website. I originally made this website in (apparently) October
of 2015, and since then I have redesigned the site only about 5 or 6 times, each
time fully re-hauling the entire infrastructure and design language. These past
two or three weeks have been spent building out an infrastructure that will
hopefully be a bit easier to manage. I still will do a ton of things manually,
however I generally prefer to touch the code myself more often than not ðŸ˜„.

I wanted to write out everything that I have done, and also talk a bit about the
code that I am using to build this site. Donâ€™t worry if you donâ€™t know that much
about web development you can still read along most of this post will be really
low level stuff.

I wanted to start this off with a brief timeline of all the visual changes I
have made to my site. Unfortunately the css for the site snapshots on the
Wayback machine doesnâ€™t seem to load (either that or it didnâ€™t collect the css).
In fact I can only find one version of the site that has working css at all and
unfortunately this version also rendered part of the site via JS so that doesnâ€™t
show up either[^1]. The version that I can find is
[here](http://web.archive.org/web/20160111084107/http://matthamlin.me/). I had
just found out about <a href="//getskeleton.com">skeleton-css</a> and wanted to
put it to use in my own website. I loved this version of my site, it was clean
and also a bit colorful.

{/* <!-- The current version of the site, shown below in case it changes in the
future, is broken down into basically 4 page types as it is now. The first is
the <a href="#image1" class="link">home page</a> the second is
<a href="#image2" class="link">my resume</a>, the third is my
<a href="#image3" class="link">blog archive</a>, and the fourth is the layout of
a <a href="#image4" class="link">blog post</a>.

### The Design:

I originally came up with the current basic design in June of this year, having
a very simple and minimal landing page really excited me. I wanted to make it
very easy for visitors to know just how much I like to keep things minimal.

Any good design article wouldn't be good without showing off the various design
assets used across the site, so below is a quick demonstration of the various
assets I used when designing and developing this version of the website.

### Code:

I was going to try and add an interactive file structure map here on this
article but figured it would be easier to discuss it. My entire site is built
off of HTML and CSS. I don't use any JS simply because I don't need any
javascript for functionality. All my HTML is hand written and I use emmet to
help in writing it efficiently. All my css is compiled from SCSS files. I do the
compiling myself on my machine before pushing to Github because Github doesn't
handle compiling when pushing new commits.

For compiling my SCSS I use Grunt, and I know its now considered an out of date
build system but I like it and I find it works pretty well for what I need it to
do.

For the most part that is the site. Everything is wired up is done by hand, I do
this because I really enjoy touching code. So whenever I make a new post I copy
my template html, edit in the title's and other data and then add a link back to
it from the archive page when I am ready to publish it.

### Footnotes:

[^1]:
    To combat this in the future I plan on making a snapshot branch on Github
    and forking those out into their separate repos (maybe).
