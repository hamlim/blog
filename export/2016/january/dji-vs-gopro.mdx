2016 is going to be a large year for tech, with a lot of potential shown for new
products rising from nothing such as the breakout hit hoverboards that came to
rise. One of the rivalries within the tech market that I am personally really
excited to see play out this year is the battle between DJI and GoPro.

Some people may be scratching their heads at this rivalry because DJI is focused
on drones, and GoPro is focused on making great action cameras, but these two
companies are on a path that leads either to a merger or to intense competition.
Both of these companies have been flirting with the other company's products.

DJI stepped into the camera market with their odd little DJI Osmo, a stabilizing
video camera in a small compact form. The Osmo is built on the technology that
DJI has developed for the camera systems on their drones. Meanwhile GoPro has
countless rumors of them developing a
[drone platform](http://techcrunch.com/2015/12/27/how-gopro-is-building-its-future-drone-platform-foundations/)
for them to build a great drone experience for customers.

These companies do currently work together in some regards, with GoPro mounts
for DJI drones but, as every technology company knows, its better to build your
own version than it is to outsource to another company. We have seen this play
out

[with](http://spectrum.ieee.org/cars-that-think/transportation/self-driving/uber-could-be-first-to-test-completely-driverless-cars-in-public)
other large tech companies.

I really hope that we get to see these companies compete over their own
respective drones in 2016. These companies are going to be great competitors and
either way the consumers will be getting great drones to use.
