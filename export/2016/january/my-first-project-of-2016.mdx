So I wanted to quickly updated this post, I have decided to shift away from the
two libraries I listed below to Skeleton and to a custom JS library. I did this
to simplify some of the development of the project to both finish the entire
project in less than 30 days, and to also simplify the development of the
application.

As I mentioned in my Building in 2016 post, I want to make sure I am building
things in 2016 primarily for me. So my first project for 2016 is going to be
focused just on one of my own pain points. First, before I jump into the full
project breakdown, I want to talk a bit about the background.

As you can read in the subtitle, this project is going to be a simple
transaction manager. I just got my first credit card this summer and so my
parents wanted me to have a better understanding and attitude towards my
finances. So I stated a Google sheet from a template to track my expenditures. I
have been using that sheet even to this day and it is completely slow,
especially on my phone. It takes a only up to around a minute to add in all the
various bits I have been tracking but those minutes add up, just like the
balance on the credit card. And the user interface of Google Sheets isn't all
that efficient yet.

So I decided that I would try to build a really simple online form where I can
quickly add in some recent expenditures. I have been tinkering around with a few
new small CSS and JS libraries so I figured why not combine this project with
what I am learning right now. I plan on building an extremely simple website
with two pages, the first is simply a form to add transactions, and the second
is going to be for showing in depth analysis on my expenditures.

For the people interested I plan on building this with:

- <a href="http://milligram.github.io/">Milligram</a> (Which I might change to
  <a href="http://getskeleton.com">Skeleton</a>)
- <a href="http://vuejs.org/">Vue.JS</a>
- <a href="https://airtable.com/">Airtable (for the database)</a>

I plan on hosting the entire project on Github so others can use the code for
their own expense tracking, and also to allow other contributors to the project
as well.

I currently am also working on <a href="http://goexploring.today">Bundles</a>
which I plan to launch in the coming 30 days or so.
