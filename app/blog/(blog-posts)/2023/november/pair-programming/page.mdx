I found this tweet earlier today that really accurately describes some of my
thinking about pair programming as of late:

<Tweet id="1728502218775531686">

    I did pair programming exclusively for years at Pivotal.

    <br />
    It’s an incredible tool.
    <br />
    <br />
    It’s also a fabulous way to never ship anything: 8 engineers (4 pairs) on a team have a really hard time gaining any consensus or direction when everything is essentially decided by committee.

However, I used to think a bit differently about pair programming so I figured
it'd be worth talking about why my opinion changed on the topic.

Before digging in though, I realized that this isn't the first time I went to
write about pair programming, I even have a stub of an article
[here](/blog/2021/november/pair-programming-stub) (just over 2 years old at this
point!), and also a semi-popular post on
[pair code reviews](/blog/2020/december/pair-code-reviews) (which is almost 3 years
old now!).

I used to really enjoy pair programming, we heavily utilized it on my current
team about 2 years back. At the time - it felt really useful and it seemed like
we were able to iterate through our work at a rapid pace. However, I feel like
that's no longer the case.

Now when our team is pairing, it feels like we're spending 2-3 maybe even 4x the
time to accomplish a task that someone individually can accomplish directly.

I don't think this is the default with pair programming however - I think it
just means we're over-using it rather than using it only when we need to.

Using pair programming to:

- Onboard a new engineer to the team,
- Tackle a gnarly bug, or
- Explore a solution to a vague problem

can be really useful.

I no longer recommend pair programming as the default for well-jelled teams
however. Instead, each individual should be able to accomplish any task on their
own.
