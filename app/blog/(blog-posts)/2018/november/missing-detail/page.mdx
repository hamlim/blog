I recently stumbled upon
[this quick read](http://johnsalvatier.org/blog/2017/reality-has-a-surprising-amount-of-detail)
about the surprising amount of detail in reality. I highly suggest reading
through the article, its fairly short. The highlights for me were the following:

> Another way to see that noticing the right details is hard, is that different
> people end up noticing different details.

> Before you’ve noticed important details they are, of course, basically
> invisible. It’s hard to put your attention on them because you don’t even know
> what you’re looking for. But after you see them they quickly become so
> integrated into your intuitive models of the world that they become
> essentially transparent.

> This means it’s really easy to get stuck. Stuck in your current way of seeing
> and thinking about things. Frames are made out of the details that seem
> important to you. The important details you haven’t noticed are invisible to
> you, and the details you have noticed seem completely obvious and you see
> right through them. This all makes makes it difficult to imagine how you could
> be missing something important.

and the kicker

> If you wish to not get stuck, seek to perceive what you have not yet
> perceived.
