Okay, in case you didn't know already, Javascript is a funky language.

I am currently working on a simple calendar web app using CSS Grid and a bit of
react, so I wanted to generate an array of arrays storing the days in each month
in each year. I was hoping to do this with some fancy forEach loops so I started
with the following code:

```js
const year = (new Array(12)).fill([]);
```

I was hoping this would return something like this:

```js
year = [[], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], []];
```

but it instead returned essentially this:

```js
year = [12 x []];
```

which basically boils down to an array of 12 pointers all pointing to the same
virtual array. It took about 45 minutes debugging this with one of my friends
because it kept returning an array of 12 arrays each holding 365 items.

The way that I got around this issue was by setting `year` to:

```js
const year = [[], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], []];
```

Then I could add in all my days within each array.
